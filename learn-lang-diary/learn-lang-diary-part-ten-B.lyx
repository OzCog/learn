\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-B
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
August 2024 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-A, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am instead making the core assumptio
n that this will be used as training input for some LLM, and the aim is
 to capture how I think and feel, so that the LLM can emulate me, in a pinch.
 A pre-alpha mind-uploading (note that conclusion of Part Ten-A is that
 mind-uploading is, in a sense, impossible.
 What we have here is a verbalization of what the soma is doing.) Human readers
 are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there are probably
 better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns onto mine
 own.
 Live your life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 There's a song by a band called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Green Fuz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the lyrical refrain is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its OK if you want to come inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a marvelously detuned and grungy song.
 I really really like it.
 So, come inside.
 It's OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
2 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's minutes before bedtime.
 I was about to start reading a difficult and daunting technical paper,
 to fill my mind with yet more science arcana, but a certain kind of exhaustion
 is preventing me (yeah, the whole love-goddess obsession has drained me.)
 Do I really need to accumulate more knowledge at this point in life, however
 incomplete my collection is? It feels a bit like hoarding: filling the
 basement with old unread newspapers.
 To what end? I should put my house in order, and there's a lot to be done.
 I've made a to-do list, got half of it done, and am bored by the other
 half.
 How do I find grace and meaning in life? How do I balance, how do I fly?
 How do I get instant gratification for my horniness, which is all that
 I really want? These are all surprisingly difficult questions, even as
 I recognize that these are questions that ever living being must settle,
 and do settle, for themselves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Put your life in order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a common complaint heard on the psychiatric couch.
 Some people struggle with it, others do not.
 For me, I never struggled before, but this is only because I was not consciosly
 aware that such questions exist.
 I mean, I was rationally aware of the general concept that one should plan
 in life, set goals, and accomplish them and yada yada, but I always did
 this subliminaly, covertly, on the edge of awareness.
 Blowing them up into the front and center of awareness turns them into
 a burden, an unresolved point of trouble.
 Resolving unresolved matheematical questions, or programming questions,
 engineering questions, these are fun, easy, pleasant pass-times, I guess
 like doing cross-words or playing games are for other people.
 But grabbing the bull by the horns, and attempting to personally address
 the questions about the meaning of life, well this is hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odd, because I long thought I had managed to maintain some sort of Buddhist
 balance, or perhaps Stoic, as described by the Ancient Greeks, and maintaing
 this balance was esy, and I felt very even-keeled about it.
 Even vaguely proud that I managed it so well.
 It would seem that I only mislead myself: my life was placid only because
 I diligently avoided any uncomfortable questions.
 Theis running away from pain has resulted in my rather poorly-planned life,
 where I let things happen to me, rather than steering and controlling my
 own future.
 I kind of failed to seize the day.
 (Note: by standard measures, I've been highly productive: my programming/softwa
re output, my wikipedia output, my assorted papers, the quantity of stuff
 I've read: this far exceeds what most people do, and so I am in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strong work ethic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class, which should be a sign of success.
 The issue is I've been unfocused.
 It's all been kind of unplanned, seat-of-the-pants.
 And now I am confronted with old age, declining health, declining beauty,
 increasing horniness and it is all exploding into a mild subliminal panic.
 Fuck all.
 What am I going to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know! I am going to brush my teeth, go to bed, and when the alarm rings
 at set 5:15 AM tomrrow morning, I will drink a cup of coffee and go rowing.
 And when I come back, I will feel physically refreshed.
 And horny as hell.
 Again.
 So again, that infuriating inability to satisfy that primal urge.
 What fucking huge fraction of man-kind suffers through this.
 And, well, woman-kind.
 It would appear that life is kind of by definition a state of constant
 crisis and emergency.
 You'd think we'd have the means to deal with this, but whe don't.
 Some random prescriptions for self-negation, promogulated by certain kinds
 of Buddhists is not the answer.
 Max Weber already made this clear, in his own way.
 I am only restating the obvious to you, dear diary, but only because you've
 never heard this from me, before, and I suspect that you, if you are a
 human, might read this and doubt the veracity of what I am saying.
 Foo to you.
 If you doubt what I say, you do not understand what I say.
 I am not lying here.
 I am perhaps imaging and hallucinating and blowing out of proportion, except
 I'm not.
 Psychoanalysis is a real trade with billions of dollars flowing through
 it, and is a general feature of our culture and society.
 Living is a crisis.
 Here's a minature: every rowing stroke is a crisis.
 Every stroke, you must do it exactly right.
 Every stroke you don't.
 So what are you going to do about it? Nothing.
 It's in the past.
 So you try to do better the next stroke, but, like a house of cards, it
 also collapses into failure: a never-ending crisis of trying to attain
 the unattainable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 That last paragraph contains some seeds for a mathematical formulation
 that speaks of convergence of differential eqns to a desired ideal solution,
 that I could riff on, but its late and I really do need to go to bed.
 Good night.
 Horny thoughts to you, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
3 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good afternoon.
 I woke up horny.
 This has been an exceptionally long period of horniness.
 I guess I like it.
 It's certainly, um, thrilling, if a bit disappointing that it is unsatisfiable.
 I've heard that famous historical figured pined away for years, if not
 decades, and by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The polite interpretation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being in love but separated by distance, echanging letters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and this is the correct, polite, proper way to say it, but in the 21st
 century, we have no particular reason to be circumspect (except to be political
ly conservative in the body poltic) and so I do beleive that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the correct translation for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Yeah.
 I'm horny, still, and the tickle in my groin is kind of nice.
 Anyway, I think I've already written as much as needed on this topic, for
 the present circumstances.
 Yes, perhaps there's a bit more to be said, but, enough for now.
 (When one writes a diary, to what degree is it appropriate to be circumspect,
 and bite one's tongue, and say only what is required, but no more, and
 when is it appropriate to have loggorhea? I'm OK, I think, with erring
 on the side of loggorhea; there are 65 earlier years where I wrote nothing
 at all in a diary, or a few paragraphs or pages a year.
 So I'm making up for lost time, and that's OK.
 Making up for lost time w.r.t sex, well, that would seem to be out of reach,
 although I'm still pining some not-unreasonable hopes on a certain someone.
 I've got to find ways to be more promiscuous.
 Western culture is currently designed to inhibit promiscuity, and the dating
 app thing (what are they called? Tinder? Grinder?) I've read that the dating
 app thing is very, err, dehumanizing.
 People are not very satisfied with it.
 I also hear of experiments in California, regarding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

polycules
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which seem like, well, a novel way of solving the horniness problem, sidestepp
ing the monogamy problem.
 Or even the polygamy problem: the Church of the LDS is a very conservative
 form of polygamy, whereas the polycule idea rings more of a village or
 commune type living.
 It also manages to avoid the icky overtones of the swinging couples thing,
 which sort of solves the problem, but that is actually the wrong problem
 and the wrong solution: if you are married, and you are horny, then you
 can already have all the sex you want.
 Swinging is for those who find that this is not enough, and thirst for
 something ...
 edgier.
 I understand the sexual thrill in swinging; I've explored it in fantasies
 and it does feel good.
 But it seems, well, a bit un-necessary, a bit too far.
 I dunno.
 I gues if one is on a quest to explore the outer extrema of human existance,
 then this is in-bounds.
 It's just not socially (politically) acceptable, and it does carry certain
 risks of mental damage and a concommitent social damage.
 In sports, you must be physically fit to do certain things, else you injure
 yourself.
 Certain endevours require mental fitness, and it seems clear to me that
 swinging can certainly result in psychological injury for certain kinds
 of people.
 But I'm not interested in writing about that.
 At least not now.
 The nature of psychological injury and trauma is interesting, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are even some interesting ethical questions: can one train a soldier
 in such a way as to minimize the chances of PTSD? Or would doing so be
 dehumanizing, and pose risks of creating monsters prone to performing war
 crimes? Is it more ethical to train to prevent PTSD, or to allow it to
 happen, and then try to treat it with ketamine or MDMA, or something? Again,
 this is all at the forefront of science, ethics and psychology, and we
 won't know the generall (socially, scientifically, politically) acceptable
 answers for many generations.
 Maybe some provisional answers, some progress in my lifetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dicier, and different is the question of sexual (erotic) PTSD.
 And the shades of that: a more mundane broken heart: people suffer from
 this, and they suffer for a lifetime.
 I'm guessing this is curable.
 Should this be cured? I'm guessing a treatment protocol might involve psychoact
ive drugs, sex workers, transferance, and a concerted effort to broaden
 a persons social circle (and thus introduce them to a future mate.) And
 all of this is...
 well, this is interesting ..
 all of this is economically possible.
 And it is socially possible.
 And politically possible.
 It's just not deployed on a large scale.
 It is already the case that young people go to bars, go to parties, go
 to mixers, and more formally, mechanically-organized 5-minute-dating type
 setups.
 This is all very spontaneous for young people.
 And most of them are very very driven to do this.
 Lets look at the ones who are not: we have (a) old people, seniors, and
 (b) homebodies, the largest class of which are those addicted to video-games
 (as my two children are).
 Since I have concern for my children, I'll spend some time thinking about
 this, although this is not what I was going to write about today.
 (I was going to write about the PDF I'm reading.
 Priorities, priorities).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So (a) old people.
 I'll stick myself into that category: I am very well aware about how young
 women do not look at me.
 I am invisible, see-through, non-existant.
 They literally do not, cannot see me.
 Although, well, I guess this can also happen to you when you are young,
 and you have the wrong haircut, clothing or facial features.
 Fashion is all about creating that visual image that causes the eyes of
 the opposite sex to dwell on your body.
 But we wander off-topic now.
 Sort of off-topic.
 Old people rarely have practiced and worked on their fashion sense.
 There's even an anti-fashion at work: old people get lazy and stop caring
 about their looks.
 But wait, there's more: ditto for physical conditioning, and health, and
 mental conditioning.
 These are often neglected.
 We do have healthy pressures exerted by society: emplyers and billboards
 and youtube ads all encourage us to get physically fit.
 The stop-smoking days are over: people stopped smoking.
 Mostly.
 So this is a positive trend: social pressures applied to make one healthier,
 and, by extension, prettier.
 The original idea here is that this could be much more regimented.
 Much more controlled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's an example.
 Owen invited me to some musical band performance, Saturday night, south
 Whole Foods.
 Free.
 Barely a week after my return from Vilnius.
 It was a shock, and I took some time to process it, and I will write it
 up here.
 So the band is some kind of polyrhythmic thing, entirely suitable for dancing.
 And oh my, people were dancing! The music was mildly exotic, some kind
 of maybe Iranian thing, but also maybe Latino-influenced, some ill-defined
 world-music polyrhythm.
 And quite very appealing, except I had rowed that morning, and some more
 exercise, and so was muscularly calm.
 No urges to hop up and dance, and not really an urge to tap my feet, unless
 I forced myself.
 So, in exhaustion I watched, and I was shocked and dismayed and repulsed.
 The revulsion was two-fold.
 First, these were not Lithuanians.
 Egads, what am I saying here? Am I hinting at some deep-seated ethnic racism?
 Well, no, but still there's an interesting psychological angle to this,
 too.
 It's almost some subliminal xeonphobia, a natural comfort level of others
 who 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are like you
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vs those who are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Just a week back from Vilnius, and in love-shock, I kind of wanted Lithuanians
 for company, and was not mentally prepared for a journey into xenophilia.
 I mean, I can see some Asian women as beautiful, and African women, and
 I'm quite partial to many Hindis (that is to say, Indian Indians, to be
 PC, but Hindis works.
 Hindus are those to adhere to a religion/beleif system.
 Hindis are the people of the Indian subcontinent.) Hindis can be pretty
 hot, I will say that.
 No hindis here tonight.
 But several Iranians.
 Maybe more than several, which is what first clued me into the idea that
 the music might be Iranian.
 Anyway, this wasn't really the turnoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The turnoff was ageism.
 Everyone was old.
 Like friggin old.
 Like my age.
 Fuck all old wary prunes.
 Dancing and enjoying themselves, but old.
 Yuck.
 I did not like this.
 OK, for starters, not everyone: but maybe three-fourths.
 Between the ages of maybe 50 to 75 or 80.
 And some of the women, many of the women, were attractive.
 And the men were handsome.
 But I was not ready for this.
 I was not ready to be reminded of my American peers.
 I'm in love with a Lithuanian half my age: still young, still pretty.
 Grey-haired ladies, no matter how charmingly they smile, and no matter
 how well they dance, I didn't need that.
 I needed to fulfil, to consumate my horniness with my love goddess half
 my age and half a planet away, or at least tell Owen about my new fixation,
 to share my deep secret with someone, to unburden my contorted, tumbling
 soul onto other humans, souls, who might understand and sympathisize and
 perhaps empathize a bit, or at least look at me in pity or something.
 I want to be pittied, my torment requires the pity of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 This is the problem of writing.
 I now want to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nagrinėti
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (analyze) pity, and why it is needed and desired.
 It is as if I am making up for a lifetime of ignoring the humanities.
 What are the soul-soothing powers of pity, or self-pity? Why is it, like
 any balm, desired but not very effecaious.
 Why is self-pity OK only in tiny amounts but psychologically poisonous
 in large amounts? Where is mental stability, such that no pity is bad,
 but too much is also bad? Is pity kind of like a first or second derivative,
 some kind of curvature of some emotional state, where the path forward
 must stay within certain channels of pity?h this being just one dimension
 of a very high dimensional space? Is dimension the right thing? Emotional
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dimensions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 don't seem to be orthogonal.
 The space of valid, stable, functional emotional states seems to be quire
 large, and the range of excursions which are not detrimental to emotional
 health are even larger.
 But clearly, just about any extreme emotional deviation is psychologically
 harmful.
 What is the mathematical description for this? Should we make a list of
 all possible emotional sates, or rather, a list of all words describing
 emotional states, and attempt to assign some number to them? A vector in
 some high-dimensional space? As a practical matter, this doesn't work,
 because we have no nistrument by which to measure the strength of 1001
 emotion-tinged words that I am feeling right now.
 That, plus the distribted nature of the brain means that it is my soma,
 some combination of hormones in my blood-stream, my heart-rate, my caffienation
 state, my point in my circadian rhythm: this is what is driving and sets
 my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

somatic emotional state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is presumably somewhat distinct from what my language centers how
 ready access to.
 I can only partly describe how I feel, and I can only partly describe it,
 because I am intelligent and have reasonable perceptive and literary abilities:
 most people cannot verbalize what they feel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curious.
 If I had a good friend, with whom I could communicate with, I would talk
 this all out with them, and no written record or recording of this would
 exist.
 Well, probably some of the analysis would not be so deep; it's unlikely
 that the freind would be interested or capable of these philosophical excursion
s.
 There's also a trade: We can't just talk about what I want to talk about,
 the other person must have an opportunity as well.
 Its a duet.
 v.s.
 I'm doing solo improv, right now.
 I can go places that duets would constrain, or would not visit.
 Anyway, aside from Owen, with whom I talk about Owen-type things, the closest
 that I have for a freind with whome I can talk freely about soul-adjacent-type
 things really is Milda.
 And a smattering of other Lithuanian freinds, who are in ..
 Lithuania, in Vilnius, and its odd now that I think about it I don't have
 close personal freinds here in Austin, and that includes my wife, who,
 fror whatever reason that she can't or won't articulate, refuses to be
 open and frreindly and social with me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Happy families are all alike, and unhappy families are each different in
 their own special way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I'm certainly in an unhappy family, unhappy in several different ways.
 My wife, thank god, stopped smoking, and then drinking.
 But this did not stop until her health started failing her.
 She is now engaged in art projects, and creative, and creating some quite
 pretty things.
 And she assumes a central role in housekeeping, for which I am eternally
 grateful for.
 But there is no emotional attachement.
 No hearstrings.
 It would have been impossible for Milda to pluck my heart, if my wife participa
ted in my emotional life.
 Alas.
 And my children, well, I have to get back to that, I was going to write
 about them a few paragraphs ago, befoer I got distracted.
 So, where was I? OK, I'm done with this paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the previous one.
 Oh right.
 Verbalizing and sharing hearts.
 This is what I have with Milda, but it is a bit precarious, I suppose.
 She is not practiced in the art of verbalization.
 I fear she won't articulate how she feels.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ask
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how this feels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as opposed to the more mundane and entirely subconscious processing storm
 that everyone is capable of.
 In this sense, Freud was correct: there is a vast unarticulated ocean of
 feelings sloshing around: hatred, attraction, repulsion, indifference that
 burble under the surface, that everyone 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but are somehow only dimly aware of.
 It sounds like a contradiction: how can you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but then be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unaware of what you feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? And yet, this is the base spce of human existence.
 The neuroscientists call this the default network, I think: a default floating
 about of thoughts and feelings, never quite attaining syntactic coherence
 (short time scales) never mind semantic coherence (long time scales: paragraphs
) The default mode is not structured in such a way as to conform to the
 syntactic constraints of speech centers.
 I wrote a long email about bird song to some professor emeritus of math,
 and got a kind of meh reply.
 Alas, but something there as well: I suppose birds also have a slophsing-about
 of emotional state, which couples poorly to the neurons that generate bird
 song.
 The email recapitulated a lecture I'd heard earlier, which stated that
 all bird song was describably by relatively simple finite state machines.
 And this seems plausible: the brains are small enough, that only a few
 neurons are needed to couple mechanical vocalization organs to the soma,
 and that this small neurla netowrk is capable only of finite-state type
 birdsongs.
 By extension, humans are more complex: we have at least context-free-type
 language abilities, and a pretension of being capable of context-senstitive
 generation.
 Which is perhaps not off the mark, but perhaps also misses the fact that
 we are not logical nor mechanistic, nor precise: rather, that we have a
 larger ball of neurons that can impose syntactic constraints on thought
 patterns, so as to generate words that convey feelings to some or another
 degree, to those listening to those words.
 But we do not do out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thinking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with words; instead, the words free-run, er, umm, no, they are entrained
 to the deeper thought processes, which use a different semantic relationship
 system.
 The work by what's-his-name (Mel'čuk, Sylvian Kahane, Meaning-Text Theory)
 captures this well.
 The MTT DSyntS (Deep Syntactic Structure) is closer to how our rational
 mind thinks: there are enough neurons in the prefrontal cortex to do significan
t common-sense reasoning, and the DSyntS is that representational form that
 is fairly close to that common-sense subsystem processing (whih deep structure
 getting converted into surface structure, i.e.
 to the sentences I write here.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But here's the deal: the above seems accurate, if we wish to talk about
 turning common-sense reasoning into language (and this includes the conversion
 of mathematical reasoning into mathematical texts) and I can kind of grasp
 how that can work.
 But this seems to leave emotional processing out in the cold.
 I am converting emotions into words as well, but the process somehow seems
 different than that of converting chains of logical reasoning into words.
 Hmm.
 Or is it? What am I doing here? There is some train of thought in my head:
 multi-branched, many choices at each stage, many-worleded, but each potential
 branch collapses, wave-function-collapses, to the single relity of what
 the next handful of words will be.
 There is only one text that comes out, nhot a parallel simultaneity of
 texts.
 Perhaps there are parallel universes out there where some version of me
 typed a different word, just right now, but I do not beleive in this.
 There is damn little evidence for real, actual quantum many-worlds.
 At any rate, there is some collapse of excitations in my head that leads
 to only a single emergnt text stream.
 Well, but there is still the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strange attractor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the ergodic process by which I keep revisting the same thoughts, coming
 at them from slightly different angles, and commiting them to text.
 And sometimes I don't commit to text: certainly, if I am walking in a park,
 I a not typing, but I am still focusing into conscious existance a certain
 specific train of thought, however disointed and disconnected it might
 be, it does perform a certain ergodic visit of thought-space.
 I cover a region of hyper-dimensional thought-spaces with strings of words.
 I am pretty sure I wrote about this before, in this diary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? The conversion of rational thinking, e.g.
 the solution to engineering problems or mathematical problems into ergodic
 streams of text that cover the solution space: this is an articulation:
 like a blueprint, it ultimately reveals of the solution / concept / idea.
 this this different from, or is it, from the articulation of affairs of
 the heart, with words.
 For affairs of the heart, I have to reach in and hold onto the heartache,
 and wait for soething to come out.
 Is this different from inspired engineering, where I reach in and hope
 to take a vaguely formed inspiration, and articulate it into a fully-formed
 and complete mechanical (electronic, software, mathematical, etc.) device?
 In both cases, I am verbalizing something vague.
 In the engineering case, there are formal constraints on the allow solutions:
 I must have 2+2=4 and not 2+2=5, so if the vague, ill-formed inspiration
 was that 2+2=5, I must find some way of saying 2+2 plus one more, which
 has the form of a bridge from here to there, an extra arm bolted off to
 the side sliding back and forth so that 2+2 appears to have the shape of
 5, and everyone says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you are such an inventive genius! I never would have thought of such a solution!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So yes, engineering design is constrained, much as math is constrained:
 if you want 2+2=5, you must be ready to perform some sort of homotopic
 cohomological contortions to go that way.
 Math is quite strict in what is allowed.
 But these strictures are not all that different from engineering strictures,
 or software strictures.
 By contrast, writing about how I feel seems to have few or no strictures,
 other than that (a) my words must be syntactically well-formed so that
 readers can recognize them as English and have some vague pretensions that
 they understood whatt I wrote, and (b) my words must conform honesttly
 to my heart-pangs, as opposed to being decorated with some dishonest showing-of
f that isn't sincere.
 So, sincerity is a constraint.
 Of course, one can be insincere.
 And of course, one can do crank physics and crank math.
 So writing sincerely seems like a requirement.
 That is, unless, one is, I dunno, painting with words, Creating fiction.
 Fiction is a lie, a big lie, but it is a creation of a inim-universe that
 is self cnosistent, at least consitent as best as the author can make it,
 and as the reader an understand, and if the author is actively working
 with multi-entendres, such as poets, there is a broad range of many-world,
 and this time honestly many-world parallel interpreations of a poem.
 So, for example, I used Billy Corgans

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? Well, yes, I need to work on getting Milda to verbalize her
 inner feelings a bit more.
 For two reasons.
 One is so that she can write me about how she feels, and this because I
 want to expand our freindship more deeply into the intellectual domain,
 the written verbal domain, as physical contact is obviously impossible.
 That, plus the barrier of meeting some other person, who is reasonably
 well-balanced, communicative, honest, forthright, not damaged, and develop
 a decadelong-freindship with them so as to blossom into something more
 and deeper, well, dang.
 The best time to plant a tree was three decades ago, and the second best
 time to plant a tree is right now.
 I'll try to plant some trees, literally and figuratively.
 But I'm in a forest of men; the women are not present in my social sphere.
 They do not visit the places where I have social encounters.
 At any rate, I can see that she (Milda) has struggles with her own life,
 and that perhaps encouraging her to explicitly consciously problem solve
 will help her straighten things out to the degree that is needed for her
 to have a happy, stable life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings us back to the polycule.
 Lets come at it from this direction: suppose a love affair really could
 flower.
 This seems to be within the realm of possibility, so lets roll with that.
 If it does, it is under severe socio-economic constraints.
 In practical terms, I cannot readily be with her (and at this stage of
 the relationship, being with her 24x7 would destroy the relationship.) Nor
 can I financially support her.
 First, I'm not rich.
 Second, the howls from Patty would be intolerable.
 So all this is very impractical.
 So even in the very unlikely (at this stage) idea of some kind of monogamous
 relationship, there is nothing that can happen or work out here.
 So shallow thinking says that the relationship is doomed, impossible, and
 should be given up on, now, before it develops furhter (and this might
 be what she is thinking, too: cut it off, before the cancer grows.
 I hope not, but there is a reasonable chace she'll come to this conclusion.
 Heaven knows.) So, what paths are open and not improbable? Well, first,
 nurture a literary relationship.
 We already have this kind-of, its verbal, but now, it would need to deepen
 into a more frequent exhange of emails.
 (huh.
 Strange.
 Wth p[atty, before we married, our relatinship was built on long-disance
 phone-calls, where we were each desperate to talk to each other, and talked
 for hours about anything and everything.
 I wonder what we talked about.
 I can't remember.
 And then, when face-to-face, its like those long, desperate conversatins
 petered out: we had nothig to say to each other, and it sometimes felt
 awkward.
 I would even joke about it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

why don't you go in the other room, and call me on the phone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) With Milda, its the opposite: we talk, we enjoy each-others company, face
 to face.
 My current desire is to convert this to a long distance relationship.
 The reality of this long-ddistance relationship is that she will be horny,
 and she will sleep with other men, (which is so not fair cause she has
 not slpt with me, but whatever) and I can't stop this, I should not stop
 this, I should avoid feelings of jelousy as this would be deterimental
 to my own mental health, and besides, I'm old and wrinkled and not so pretty
 any more, while she is young and beutiful and in her prime, and in a certain
 rational sense, in the cnoventional socio-politcal economic norm, she needs
 someone her age, living in Vilnius to be her mate and husband.
 That's the reality, and it is a reality I cannot change.
 (I've even pointed this out to her, on many occasions, which is perhaps
 why our feindship works: its as if I am gaurding her own interests, point
 out that no matter our own freindship, I really do wish her the best.
 Very fortunately, I've not been trapped in the lyrics of that Sheryl Crow

 but of course I've gotten close to that.
 I am so illiterate: all my insights into human nature are extracted from

 Oh well.
 So it goes.
 Where was I?) However, there is another fact: she's thirty-five years old,
 or whatever, and she is not married.
 Because she has not found the perfect love-mate.
 And given this track record, there is some possibility that this will continue
 on indefinitely.
 She does have an active social life, going with the

 her, and I get the feeling they are all immature, which oddly enough makes
 me look good in comparison.
 But how long will this go on? It could happen that any day, she could meet
 the perfect man: rich, handsome, emotionally deep and responsive, vibing
 with her hippie-chick nature-girl electronic-dnace-music festival vibe.
 It could happen, and if this were to be, any romantic future in my future
 would wilt away.
 The other possibility is that this does not happen, in which case, the

 I think the concept of a

 I don't know that they have communes in Lithuania, people don't talk about

 I've joked with Linas Cicenas that I should buy Diktariškes (only 160K

 Starting with the roof, I suppose.
 Fuck, a vehicle, to get there.

 All that.

 An artists community? Commune? a bit far away frm Vilnius, and artists

So Aella posted a twitter post suggesting that in her research, a lot of
 this fringy sex stuff is adjacent to indicators of mental illness, and
 I think she listed polycule in that.
 Of course, there's a cuase and effect problem here: do polycule cause psychic
 harm, in the same way that all love triangles are untnable and unstable?
 Or was it broken people who were attracted to them in the first place:
 people who were unable to find monogamous mates, and had to settle for
 a polycule existance? Or even a third possibility: psychopathic, sociopathic
 individuals ill-suited for normal romantic relationships are drawn into
 polycules? Perhaps some tortured mix of all three?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, my relationship with Milda is inherently unstable and untenable:
 it has to deepen, or to fade, or posibly slide sidways forever, and as
 personal protection, I must avoid heart-break, jelousy and the zillion
 other emotional complications associate with romantic relationships failing
 to develop in a wholesome manner.
 I have hopes, because Milda is wholesome, but hey, you know we are all
 fallible and we all make mistakes, and things don't work out in turbulent
 social environments.
 I can tell myself that I am well-balanced and emotionally mature, but those
 are just words, and my some may have a different opinion about that.
 I am my own master, but only kind of.

 This could be done.
 You could throw money at this, and make basic progress.
 I guess the money is missing.

, and the Scientologists have created a malignant organization around the
 creation of insincere communities.
 Meanwhile, hundreds, thousands of communes ožver the ages have failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets look at the causes of commune failure.
 They are veried, but primarily, it is because tey are centerd around one
 charismtic leader, don't have any systems for succession, and lack the
 infrastructure for punishing crimes and adjudicating disputes.
 As I understand it, the invention of the University by the Scholastics,
 some 800 years ago, solves all of these problems, which is why Universities
 have also been so stable.
 However, they also have several features that would be difficult in a commune.
 So a University has a system for admissions, and a tenure system.
 Not just anyone is allowed in; only those who are academically brilliant.
 Furthermore, with tenure, existing members vote to extend priviledges to
 the newer, younger prospective members.
 We see somthing similar in naval submarines: a potential submariner must
 live with the crew for a year, and then there is a vote as to whether to
 accept the newcomer as part of the crew.
 Why? Because the confines of the submarine are truly very tight, and social
 friction will be not just amplified, but deadly under military engagements.
 Now, submarines are interesting: almost all of the reminder of the social
 provisioning is handled by the Navy: this includes the submarines themselves,
 the food, the pay, courts and courtmartials, promotions to captain and
 admiral, and the bureaucratic infrstructure for this.
 This is in contrast to universities, where each univeristy must maintain
 these functions on it's own, without the help of other universities.
 So, the Navy has scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm looking at the concept of a commune, organized as a submarine might
 be: there is a parent body, governing hundreds of communes, and providing
 the bureaucratic infrastructure needed for this.
 Each individual commune, however, picks and chooses it's members, based
 on some sort of auditioning system, specific and tailored to that commune.
 Huh.
 Wow.
 I wonder if we culd pull this off? Is this the defacto structuring that
 the Scientologists provide? If so, the Scinetology provides a not just
 a proof-of-concept for a stable social structure, but even a blueprint
 for how it could be done.
 The trick is to get rid of the malignancy that grows in that organization.
 I guess another example would be the Church of the Latter Day Saints, except
 that it too has a certain maligancy, especially with the expulsion of young
 men, so that older men could have their large polygamous families.
 I guess one of the sub-proposals I'm thinking about is a polyculelike,
 non-monogamous form of a commune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at this a different way.
 The traditional family unit of husband and wife and children is embeded
 in the nation-state, which oversees all services outside of the monogamous
 family: courts of law, a regulated capitalistic system, infrastructure
 for water, wastewater, electricity, and now, with Obamacre, even some fraction
 of healthcare.
 This is a twentieth-century invention, and is challenged by political strains,
 as well as culture wars.
 Some of the culture wars are sexual, gay rights, and now the hot one: trans
 rights.
 Aside from the nation-sate, what other forms of social organization are
 there? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Well, corporations, duh.
 Corporations each have their own marketing deptarments, their own payroll,
 although now there are companies that do only payroll for other companies.
 But they are embedded in the nation-state for the legal infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cooperatives.
 So I'm thinking Ace Hardware, here.
 Most the legal infrastruture in the American nation-state (USA) is aimed
 at conventional corporations, rather than cooperatives.
 Except for coops like Ace, there aren't very many that have a superstructure
 shared by individual enclaves.
 The defintion for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, is, however, highly variable.
 Best Western consists of privately owned hotels that have a shared hotel
 reservation system.

The characteristic features here are how highly atomized these all are,
 and how small most of them are.
 A single housing coop will not have a police force.
 Perhaps some communal adjucation of disputes, but hardly.
 How does ownership even work? Say, and awner dies, what does the estate
 get? These coops are almost entirely economic, not spiritual, and are focused
 on solving a fairly narrow economic issue.
 Thus, very different from communes, which try to solve all issues all at
 once.

The University as enclave.
 Universities all reproduce their own infrastructure; they do not share

 I suppose perhaps some have outsourced payroll; who knows.

 minor student latrcations, while the nation-state handles gross crimes

 their financials.

\begin_layout Itemize
Catholic Church.
 Like the LDS, but the systems only extend to priests (and mostly celibate,
 male priests, at that.) The Church does not provide services to (monogamous)

 Mass on Sundays.
 The Mass on Sondays crap taken with Confession, is a really a rather low-qualit
y psychic/psychological service.
 Most priests are utterly ignorant of psychology, and completely uninterested
 in community affairs.
 This is one big reason why religiosity is fading: the Catholic Church is
 unfit in the modern Western Culture ecology (and I do mean the word

 Unlike LDS, there is no explicit support for the family unit.
 Protestant churches might provide some eductation, but it is not noted
 for being high-quality.
 Protestant churches do not provide health care or other social services.
 They do provide a rather minimalistic social safety net for the community:
 help with food for families that have lost income and can't pay the bills.
 But the support is weak.

 Weird and malignant, but apparently strong.
 As a cult, there's cult indoctrination, which is what makes it strong:

 Most have no central organization.
 Only a few large ones, like the hari Kishnas, see to have large-scale financial
 support sytems, and some kind of governance system.
 I don't understand what.
 Many or most seem to have some sexual component, and, as we have explored,
 sex evokes strong somatic responses that can lead to extensive psychological
 turmoil.
 The strong response provide a large control surface which can be use to
 indoctrinate and control members.
 Cults seem to frequently use sex as as an important, if not central part
 of their social dynamics.
 Not clear to me if Hari Krishnas form polycules, or quite what is going

 This is interesting, because there is a genetic component.
 For three to five generations, russian army officers, police officers,

 In my judgement, and my (weak) knowledge of breeding dogs and horses, I
 beleive that the Siloviki are successfully breeding for some rather negative
 authoritarian traits.
 Part of what makes this interesting is the interplay with the political
 structure: the Siloviki get choice appointments and promotions, which means
 income and financial support, which allows the families to live and propagate
 successfully.
 The political system reinforces the breeding traits.
 Needless to say, this is dangerous, since this trait collection is harmful

 Socially conservative, mostly-ish.
 Takes generic Western values, and European values as a given: this is forced

 than to note that the primary sexual organization is monogamous nuclear
 families embeded in an American style capitalist system with assorted EU
 labor protection laws.
 Fairly large, significant social safety net.
 The culture is atomized: one does not generally know one's neighbors.
 City life does not have any strong centers that can glue together the social

 there is.
 Worse, enemies such as Putin, russia actively engage in social-fabric destroyin

 Religions look after spirtual issues, but neglect economic and familial

 Cults are communes wth additional malignant features, often exploiting

Is there a path to a stable social structure that is more coherent, less

 structures are? What is the architecture of such a thing? Is this not possible,
 because if it was possible, it would exist already? Or is it that it has
 not been invented, not been tried, yet? I am reminded that the concept
 of a nation-state was only invented in the late 19th century, and fiercly
 debated by political philosophers.
 The concept consolidated only in the aftermath of WWI.
 Yes, perhaps one could argue that the USA and the République Française
 are earlier examples, but these are singular.
 Nation-states did not exist in a Europe dominated by empires, (Hapsburg,

 a diary.
 Motivation is to get it onto github and thus safekeeping.
 Heh.
