\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-B
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
August 2024 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-A, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am instead making the core assumptio
n that this will be used as training input for some LLM, and the aim is
 to capture how I think and feel, so that the LLM can emulate me, in a pinch.
 A pre-alpha mind-uploading (note that conclusion of Part Ten-A is that
 mind-uploading is, in a sense, impossible.
 What we have here is a verbalization of what the soma is doing.) Human readers
 are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there are probably
 better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns onto mine
 own.
 Live your life.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 There's a song by a band called

 and the lyrical refrain is

.
 It is a marvelously detuned and grungy song.
 I really really like it.
 So, come inside.
 It's OK.

It's minutes before bedtime.
 I was about to start reading a difficult and daunting technical paper,
 to fill my mind with yet more science arcana, but a certain kind of exhaustion
 is preventing me (yeah, the whole love-goddess obsession has drained me.)
 Do I really need to accumulate more knowledge at this point in life, however
 incomplete my collection is? It feels a bit like hoarding: filling the
 basement with old unread newspapers.
 To what end? I should put my house in order, and there's a lot to be done.
 I've made a to-do list, got half of it done, and am bored by the other
 half.
 How do I find grace and meaning in life? How do I balance, how do I fly?
 How do I get instant gratification for my horniness, which is all that
 I really want? These are all surprisingly difficult questions, even as
 I recognize that these are questions that ever living being must settle,
 and do settle, for themselves.

 is a common complaint heard on the psychiatric couch.
 Some people struggle with it, others do not.
 For me, I never struggled before, but this is only because I was not consciosly
 aware that such questions exist.
 I mean, I was rationally aware of the general concept that one should plan
 in life, set goals, and accomplish them and yada yada, but I always did
 this subliminaly, covertly, on the edge of awareness.
 Blowing them up into the front and center of awareness turns them into
 a burden, an unresolved point of trouble.
 Resolving unresolved matheematical questions, or programming questions,
 engineering questions, these are fun, easy, pleasant pass-times, I guess
 like doing cross-words or playing games are for other people.
 But grabbing the bull by the horns, and attempting to personally address
 the questions about the meaning of life, well this is hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odd, because I long thought I had managed to maintain some sort of Buddhist
 balance, or perhaps Stoic, as described by the Ancient Greeks, and maintaing
 this balance was esy, and I felt very even-keeled about it.
 Even vaguely proud that I managed it so well.
 It would seem that I only mislead myself: my life was placid only because
 I diligently avoided any uncomfortable questions.
 Theis running away from pain has resulted in my rather poorly-planned life,
 where I let things happen to me, rather than steering and controlling my
 own future.
 I kind of failed to seize the day.
 (Note: by standard measures, I've been highly productive: my programming/softwa
re output, my wikipedia output, my assorted papers, the quantity of stuff
 I've read: this far exceeds what most people do, and so I am in this

 class, which should be a sign of success.
 The issue is I've been unfocused.
 It's all been kind of unplanned, seat-of-the-pants.
 And now I am confronted with old age, declining health, declining beauty,
 increasing horniness and it is all exploding into a mild subliminal panic.
 Fuck all.
 What am I going to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know! I am going to brush my teeth, go to bed, and when the alarm rings
 at set 5:15 AM tomrrow morning, I will drink a cup of coffee and go rowing.
 And when I come back, I will feel physically refreshed.
 And horny as hell.
 Again.
 So again, that infuriating inability to satisfy that primal urge.
 What fucking huge fraction of man-kind suffers through this.
 And, well, woman-kind.
 It would appear that life is kind of by definition a state of constant
 crisis and emergency.
 You'd think we'd have the means to deal with this, but whe don't.
 Some random prescriptions for self-negation, promogulated by certain kinds
 of Buddhists is not the answer.
 Max Weber already made this clear, in his own way.
 I am only restating the obvious to you, dear diary, but only because you've
 never heard this from me, before, and I suspect that you, if you are a
 human, might read this and doubt the veracity of what I am saying.
 Foo to you.
 If you doubt what I say, you do not understand what I say.
 I am not lying here.
 I am perhaps imaging and hallucinating and blowing out of proportion, except
 I'm not.
 Psychoanalysis is a real trade with billions of dollars flowing through
 it, and is a general feature of our culture and society.
 Living is a crisis.
 Here's a minature: every rowing stroke is a crisis.
 Every stroke, you must do it exactly right.
 Every stroke you don't.
 So what are you going to do about it? Nothing.
 It's in the past.
 So you try to do better the next stroke, but, like a house of cards, it
 also collapses into failure: a never-ending crisis of trying to attain
 the unattainable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 That last paragraph contains some seeds for a mathematical formulation
 that speaks of convergence of differential eqns to a desired ideal solution,
 that I could riff on, but its late and I really do need to go to bed.
 Good night.
 Horny thoughts to you, too.
