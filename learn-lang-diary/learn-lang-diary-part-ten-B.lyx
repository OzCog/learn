\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-B
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
August 2024 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-A, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am instead making the core assumptio
n that this will be used as training input for some LLM, and the aim is
 to capture how I think and feel, so that the LLM can emulate me, in a pinch.
 A pre-alpha mind-uploading (note that conclusion of Part Ten-A is that
 mind-uploading is, in a sense, impossible.
 What we have here is a verbalization of what the soma is doing.) Human readers
 are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there are probably
 better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns onto mine
 own.
 Live your life.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 There's a song by a band called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Green Fuz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the lyrical refrain is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its OK if you want to come inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a marvelously detuned and grungy song.
 I really really like it.
 So, come inside.
 It's OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
2 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's minutes before bedtime.
 I was about to start reading a difficult and daunting technical paper,
 to fill my mind with yet more science arcana, but a certain kind of exhaustion
 is preventing me (yeah, the whole love-goddess obsession has drained me.)
 Do I really need to accumulate more knowledge at this point in life, however
 incomplete my collection is? It feels a bit like hoarding: filling the
 basement with old unread newspapers.
 To what end? I should put my house in order, and there's a lot to be done.
 I've made a to-do list, got half of it done, and am bored by the other
 half.
 How do I find grace and meaning in life? How do I balance, how do I fly?
 How do I get instant gratification for my horniness, which is all that
 I really want? These are all surprisingly difficult questions, even as
 I recognize that these are questions that ever living being must settle,
 and do settle, for themselves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Put your life in order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a common complaint heard on the psychiatric couch.
 Some people struggle with it, others do not.
 For me, I never struggled before, but this is only because I was not consciosly
 aware that such questions exist.
 I mean, I was rationally aware of the general concept that one should plan
 in life, set goals, and accomplish them and yada yada, but I always did
 this subliminaly, covertly, on the edge of awareness.
 Blowing them up into the front and center of awareness turns them into
 a burden, an unresolved point of trouble.
 Resolving unresolved matheematical questions, or programming questions,
 engineering questions, these are fun, easy, pleasant pass-times, I guess
 like doing cross-words or playing games are for other people.
 But grabbing the bull by the horns, and attempting to personally address
 the questions about the meaning of life, well this is hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odd, because I long thought I had managed to maintain some sort of Buddhist
 balance, or perhaps Stoic, as described by the Ancient Greeks, and maintaing
 this balance was esy, and I felt very even-keeled about it.
 Even vaguely proud that I managed it so well.
 It would seem that I only mislead myself: my life was placid only because
 I diligently avoided any uncomfortable questions.
 Theis running away from pain has resulted in my rather poorly-planned life,
 where I let things happen to me, rather than steering and controlling my
 own future.
 I kind of failed to seize the day.
 (Note: by standard measures, I've been highly productive: my programming/softwa
re output, my wikipedia output, my assorted papers, the quantity of stuff
 I've read: this far exceeds what most people do, and so I am in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strong work ethic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class, which should be a sign of success.
 The issue is I've been unfocused.
 It's all been kind of unplanned, seat-of-the-pants.
 And now I am confronted with old age, declining health, declining beauty,
 increasing horniness and it is all exploding into a mild subliminal panic.
 Fuck all.
 What am I going to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know! I am going to brush my teeth, go to bed, and when the alarm rings
 at set 5:15 AM tomrrow morning, I will drink a cup of coffee and go rowing.
 And when I come back, I will feel physically refreshed.
 And horny as hell.
 Again.
 So again, that infuriating inability to satisfy that primal urge.
 What fucking huge fraction of man-kind suffers through this.
 And, well, woman-kind.
 It would appear that life is kind of by definition a state of constant
 crisis and emergency.
 You'd think we'd have the means to deal with this, but whe don't.
 Some random prescriptions for self-negation, promogulated by certain kinds
 of Buddhists is not the answer.
 Max Weber already made this clear, in his own way.
 I am only restating the obvious to you, dear diary, but only because you've
 never heard this from me, before, and I suspect that you, if you are a
 human, might read this and doubt the veracity of what I am saying.
 Foo to you.
 If you doubt what I say, you do not understand what I say.
 I am not lying here.
 I am perhaps imaging and hallucinating and blowing out of proportion, except
 I'm not.
 Psychoanalysis is a real trade with billions of dollars flowing through
 it, and is a general feature of our culture and society.
 Living is a crisis.
 Here's a minature: every rowing stroke is a crisis.
 Every stroke, you must do it exactly right.
 Every stroke you don't.
 So what are you going to do about it? Nothing.
 It's in the past.
 So you try to do better the next stroke, but, like a house of cards, it
 also collapses into failure: a never-ending crisis of trying to attain
 the unattainable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 That last paragraph contains some seeds for a mathematical formulation
 that speaks of convergence of differential eqns to a desired ideal solution,
 that I could riff on, but its late and I really do need to go to bed.
 Good night.
 Horny thoughts to you, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
3 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good afternoon.
 I woke up horny.
 This has been an exceptionally long period of horniness.
 I guess I like it.
 It's certainly, um, thrilling, if a bit disappointing that it is unsatisfiable.
 I've heard that famous historical figured pined away for years, if not
 decades, and by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The polite interpretation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being in love but separated by distance, echanging letters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and this is the correct, polite, proper way to say it, but in the 21st
 century, we have no particular reason to be circumspect (except to be political
ly conservative in the body poltic) and so I do beleive that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the correct translation for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Yeah.
 I'm horny, still, and the tickle in my groin is kind of nice.
 Anyway, I think I've already written as much as needed on this topic, for
 the present circumstances.
 Yes, perhaps there's a bit more to be said, but, enough for now.
 (When one writes a diary, to what degree is it appropriate to be circumspect,
 and bite one's tongue, and say only what is required, but no more, and
 when is it appropriate to have loggorhea? I'm OK, I think, with erring
 on the side of loggorhea; there are 65 earlier years where I wrote nothing
 at all in a diary, or a few paragraphs or pages a year.
 So I'm making up for lost time, and that's OK.
 Making up for lost time w.r.t sex, well, that would seem to be out of reach,
 although I'm still pining some not-unreasonable hopes on a certain someone.
 I've got to find ways to be more promiscuous.
 Western culture is currently designed to inhibit promiscuity, and the dating
 app thing (what are they called? Tinder? Grinder?) I've read that the dating
 app thing is very, err, dehumanizing.
 People are not very satisfied with it.
 I also hear of experiments in California, regarding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

polycules
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which seem like, well, a novel way of solving the horniness problem, sidestepp
ing the monogamy problem.
 Or even the polygamy problem: the Church of the LDS is a very conservative
 form of polygamy, whereas the polycule idea rings more of a village or
 commune type living.
 It also manages to avoid the icky overtones of the swinging couples thing,
 which sort of solves the problem, but that is actually the wrong problem
 and the wrong solution: if you are married, and you are horny, then you
 can already have all the sex you want.
 Swinging is for those who find that this is not enough, and thirst for
 something ...
 edgier.
 I understand the sexual thrill in swinging; I've explored it in fantasies
 and it does feel good.
 But it seems, well, a bit un-necessary, a bit too far.
 I dunno.
 I gues if one is on a quest to explore the outer extrema of human existance,
 then this is in-bounds.
 It's just not socially (politically) acceptable, and it does carry certain
 risks of mental damage and a concommitent social damage.
 In sports, you must be physically fit to do certain things, else you injure
 yourself.
 Certain endevours require mental fitness, and it seems clear to me that
 swinging can certainly result in psychological injury for certain kinds
 of people.
 But I'm not interested in writing about that.
 At least not now.
 The nature of psychological injury and trauma is interesting, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are even some interesting ethical questions: can one train a soldier
 in such a way as to minimize the chances of PTSD? Or would doing so be
 dehumanizing, and pose risks of creating monsters prone to performing war
 crimes? Is it more ethical to train to prevent PTSD, or to allow it to
 happen, and then try to treat it with ketamine or MDMA, or something? Again,
 this is all at the forefront of science, ethics and psychology, and we
 won't know the generall (socially, scientifically, politically) acceptable
 answers for many generations.
 Maybe some provisional answers, some progress in my lifetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dicier, and different is the question of sexual (erotic) PTSD.
 And the shades of that: a more mundane broken heart: people suffer from
 this, and they suffer for a lifetime.
 I'm guessing this is curable.
 Should this be cured? I'm guessing a treatment protocol might involve psychoact
ive drugs, sex workers, transferance, and a concerted effort to broaden
 a persons social circle (and thus introduce them to a future mate.) And
 all of this is...
 well, this is interesting ..
 all of this is economically possible.
 And it is socially possible.
 And politically possible.
 It's just not deployed on a large scale.
 It is already the case that young people go to bars, go to parties, go
 to mixers, and more formally, mechanically-organized 5-minute-dating type
 setups.
 This is all very spontaneous for young people.
 And most of them are very very driven to do this.
 Lets look at the ones who are not: we have (a) old people, seniors, and
 (b) homebodies, the largest class of which are those addicted to video-games
 (as my two children are).
 Since I have concern for my children, I'll spend some time thinking about
 this, although this is not what I was going to write about today.
 (I was going to write about the PDF I'm reading.
 Priorities, priorities).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So (a) old people.
 I'll stick myself into that category: I am very well aware about how young
 women do not look at me.
 I am invisible, see-through, non-existant.
 They literally do not, cannot see me.
 Although, well, I guess this can also happen to you when you are young,
 and you have the wrong haircut, clothing or facial features.
 Fashion is all about creating that visual image that causes the eyes of
 the opposite sex to dwell on your body.
 But we wander off-topic now.
 Sort of off-topic.
 Old people rarely have practiced and worked on their fashion sense.
 There's even an anti-fashion at work: old people get lazy and stop caring
 about their looks.
 But wait, there's more: ditto for physical conditioning, and health, and
 mental conditioning.
 These are often neglected.
 We do have healthy pressures exerted by society: emplyers and billboards
 and youtube ads all encourage us to get physically fit.
 The stop-smoking days are over: people stopped smoking.
 Mostly.
 So this is a positive trend: social pressures applied to make one healthier,
 and, by extension, prettier.
 The original idea here is that this could be much more regimented.
 Much more controlled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's an example.
 Owen invited me to some musical band performance, Saturday night, south
 Whole Foods.
 Free.
 Barely a week after my return from Vilnius.
 It was a shock, and I took some time to process it, and I will write it
 up here.
 So the band is some kind of polyrhythmic thing, entirely suitable for dancing.
 And oh my, people were dancing! The music was mildly exotic, some kind
 of maybe Iranian thing, but also maybe Latino-influenced, some ill-defined
 world-music polyrhythm.
 And quite very appealing, except I had rowed that morning, and some more
 exercise, and so was muscularly calm.
 No urges to hop up and dance, and not really an urge to tap my feet, unless
 I forced myself.
 So, in exhaustion I watched, and I was shocked and dismayed and repulsed.
 The revulsion was two-fold.
 First, these were not Lithuanians.
 Egads, what am I saying here? Am I hinting at some deep-seated ethnic racism?
 Well, no, but still there's an interesting psychological angle to this,
 too.
 It's almost some subliminal xeonphobia, a natural comfort level of others
 who 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are like you
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vs those who are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Just a week back from Vilnius, and in love-shock, I kind of wanted Lithuanians
 for company, and was not mentally prepared for a journey into xenophilia.
 I mean, I can see some Asian women as beautiful, and African women, and
 I'm quite partial to many Hindis (that is to say, Indian Indians, to be
 PC, but Hindis works.
 Hindus are those to adhere to a religion/beleif system.
 Hindis are the people of the Indian subcontinent.) Hindis can be pretty
 hot, I will say that.
 No hindis here tonight.
 But several Iranians.
 Maybe more than several, which is what first clued me into the idea that
 the music might be Iranian.
 Anyway, this wasn't really the turnoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The turnoff was ageism.
 Everyone was old.
 Like friggin old.
 Like my age.
 Fuck all old wary prunes.
 Dancing and enjoying themselves, but old.
 Yuck.
 I did not like this.
 OK, for starters, not everyone: but maybe three-fourths.
 Between the ages of maybe 50 to 75 or 80.
 And some of the women, many of the women, were attractive.
 And the men were handsome.
 But I was not ready for this.
 I was not ready to be reminded of my American peers.
 I'm in love with a Lithuanian half my age: still young, still pretty.
 Grey-haired ladies, no matter how charmingly they smile, and no matter
 how well they dance, I didn't need that.
 I needed to fulfil, to consumate my horniness with my love goddess half
 my age and half a planet away, or at least tell Owen about my new fixation,
 to share my deep secret with someone, to unburden my contorted, tumbling
 soul onto other humans, souls, who might understand and sympathisize and
 perhaps empathize a bit, or at least look at me in pity or something.
 I want to be pittied, my torment requires the pity of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 This is the problem of writing.
 I now want to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nagrinėti
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (analyze) pity, and why it is needed and desired.
 It is as if I am making up for a lifetime of ignoring the humanities.
 What are the soul-soothing powers of pity, or self-pity? Why is it, like
 any balm, desired but not very effecaious.
 Why is self-pity OK only in tiny amounts but psychologically poisonous
 in large amounts? Where is mental stability, such that no pity is bad,
 but too much is also bad? Is pity kind of like a first or second derivative,
 some kind of curvature of some emotional state, where the path forward
 must stay within certain channels of pity?h this being just one dimension
 of a very high dimensional space? Is dimension the right thing? Emotional
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dimensions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 don't seem to be orthogonal.
 The space of valid, stable, functional emotional states seems to be quire
 large, and the range of excursions which are not detrimental to emotional
 health are even larger.
 But clearly, just about any extreme emotional deviation is psychologically
 harmful.
 What is the mathematical description for this? Should we make a list of
 all possible emotional sates, or rather, a list of all words describing
 emotional states, and attempt to assign some number to them? A vector in
 some high-dimensional space? As a practical matter, this doesn't work,
 because we have no nistrument by which to measure the strength of 1001
 emotion-tinged words that I am feeling right now.
 That, plus the distribted nature of the brain means that it is my soma,
 some combination of hormones in my blood-stream, my heart-rate, my caffienation
 state, my point in my circadian rhythm: this is what is driving and sets
 my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

someatic emotional state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is presumably somewhat distinct from what my language centers how
 ready access to.
 I can only partly describe how I feel, and I can only partly describe it,
 because I am intellgent and have reasonable perceptive and literary abilities:
 most people cannot verbalize what they feel.
