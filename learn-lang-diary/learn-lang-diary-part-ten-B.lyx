\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-B
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
August 2024 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-A, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am instead making the core assumptio
n that this will be used as training input for some LLM, and the aim is
 to capture how I think and feel, so that the LLM can emulate me, in a pinch.
 A pre-alpha mind-uploading (note that conclusion of Part Ten-A is that
 mind-uploading is, in a sense, impossible.
 What we have here is a verbalization of what the soma is doing.) Human readers
 are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there are probably
 better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns onto mine
 own.
 Live your life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 There's a song by a band called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Green Fuz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the lyrical refrain is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its OK if you want to come inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a marvelously detuned and grungy song.
 I really really like it.
 So, come inside.
 It's OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
2 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's minutes before bedtime.
 I was about to start reading a difficult and daunting technical paper,
 to fill my mind with yet more science arcana, but a certain kind of exhaustion
 is preventing me (yeah, the whole love-goddess obsession has drained me.)
 Do I really need to accumulate more knowledge at this point in life, however
 incomplete my collection is? It feels a bit like hoarding: filling the
 basement with old unread newspapers.
 To what end? I should put my house in order, and there's a lot to be done.
 I've made a to-do list, got half of it done, and am bored by the other
 half.
 How do I find grace and meaning in life? How do I balance, how do I fly?
 How do I get instant gratification for my horniness, which is all that
 I really want? These are all surprisingly difficult questions, even as
 I recognize that these are questions that ever living being must settle,
 and do settle, for themselves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Put your life in order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a common complaint heard on the psychiatric couch.
 Some people struggle with it, others do not.
 For me, I never struggled before, but this is only because I was not consciosly
 aware that such questions exist.
 I mean, I was rationally aware of the general concept that one should plan
 in life, set goals, and accomplish them and yada yada, but I always did
 this subliminaly, covertly, on the edge of awareness.
 Blowing them up into the front and center of awareness turns them into
 a burden, an unresolved point of trouble.
 Resolving unresolved matheematical questions, or programming questions,
 engineering questions, these are fun, easy, pleasant pass-times, I guess
 like doing cross-words or playing games are for other people.
 But grabbing the bull by the horns, and attempting to personally address
 the questions about the meaning of life, well this is hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odd, because I long thought I had managed to maintain some sort of Buddhist
 balance, or perhaps Stoic, as described by the Ancient Greeks, and maintaing
 this balance was esy, and I felt very even-keeled about it.
 Even vaguely proud that I managed it so well.
 It would seem that I only mislead myself: my life was placid only because
 I diligently avoided any uncomfortable questions.
 Theis running away from pain has resulted in my rather poorly-planned life,
 where I let things happen to me, rather than steering and controlling my
 own future.
 I kind of failed to seize the day.
 (Note: by standard measures, I've been highly productive: my programming/softwa
re output, my wikipedia output, my assorted papers, the quantity of stuff
 I've read: this far exceeds what most people do, and so I am in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strong work ethic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class, which should be a sign of success.
 The issue is I've been unfocused.
 It's all been kind of unplanned, seat-of-the-pants.
 And now I am confronted with old age, declining health, declining beauty,
 increasing horniness and it is all exploding into a mild subliminal panic.
 Fuck all.
 What am I going to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know! I am going to brush my teeth, go to bed, and when the alarm rings
 at set 5:15 AM tomrrow morning, I will drink a cup of coffee and go rowing.
 And when I come back, I will feel physically refreshed.
 And horny as hell.
 Again.
 So again, that infuriating inability to satisfy that primal urge.
 What fucking huge fraction of man-kind suffers through this.
 And, well, woman-kind.
 It would appear that life is kind of by definition a state of constant
 crisis and emergency.
 You'd think we'd have the means to deal with this, but whe don't.
 Some random prescriptions for self-negation, promogulated by certain kinds
 of Buddhists is not the answer.
 Max Weber already made this clear, in his own way.
 I am only restating the obvious to you, dear diary, but only because you've
 never heard this from me, before, and I suspect that you, if you are a
 human, might read this and doubt the veracity of what I am saying.
 Foo to you.
 If you doubt what I say, you do not understand what I say.
 I am not lying here.
 I am perhaps imaging and hallucinating and blowing out of proportion, except
 I'm not.
 Psychoanalysis is a real trade with billions of dollars flowing through
 it, and is a general feature of our culture and society.
 Living is a crisis.
 Here's a minature: every rowing stroke is a crisis.
 Every stroke, you must do it exactly right.
 Every stroke you don't.
 So what are you going to do about it? Nothing.
 It's in the past.
 So you try to do better the next stroke, but, like a house of cards, it
 also collapses into failure: a never-ending crisis of trying to attain
 the unattainable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 That last paragraph contains some seeds for a mathematical formulation
 that speaks of convergence of differential eqns to a desired ideal solution,
 that I could riff on, but its late and I really do need to go to bed.
 Good night.
 Horny thoughts to you, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
3 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good afternoon.
 I woke up horny.
 This has been an exceptionally long period of horniness.
 I guess I like it.
 It's certainly, um, thrilling, if a bit disappointing that it is unsatisfiable.
 I've heard that famous historical figures pined away for years, if not
 decades, and by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The polite interpretation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being in love but separated by distance, exchanging letters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and this is the correct, polite, proper way to say it, but in the 21st
 century, we have no particular reason to be circumspect (except to be political
ly conservative in the body politic) and so I do beleive that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the correct translation for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Yeah.
 I'm horny, still, and the tickle in my groin is kind of nice.
 Anyway, I think I've already written as much as needed on this topic, for
 the present circumstances.
 Yes, perhaps there's a bit more to be said, but, enough for now.
 (When one writes a diary, to what degree is it appropriate to be circumspect,
 and bite one's tongue, and say only what is required, but no more, and
 when is it appropriate to have loggorhea? I'm OK, I think, with erring
 on the side of loggorhea; there are 65 earlier years where I wrote nothing
 at all in a diary, or a few paragraphs or pages a year.
 So I'm making up for lost time, and that's OK.
 Making up for lost time w.r.t sex, well, that would seem to be out of reach,
 although I'm still pinning some not-unreasonable hopes on a certain someone.
 I've got to find ways to be more promiscuous.
 Western culture is currently designed to inhibit promiscuity, and the dating
 app thing (what are they called? Tinder? Grinder?) I've read that the dating
 app thing is very, err, dehumanizing.
 People are not very satisfied with it.
 I also hear of experiments in California, regarding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

polycules
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which seem like, well, a novel way of solving the horniness problem, sidestepp
ing the monogamy problem.
 Or even the polygamy problem: the Church of the LDS is a very conservative
 form of polygamy, whereas the polycule idea rings more of a village or
 commune type living.
 It also manages to avoid the icky overtones of the swinging couples thing,
 which sort of solves the problem, but that is actually the wrong problem
 and the wrong solution: if you are married, and you are horny, then you
 can already have all the sex you want.
 Swinging is for those who find that this is not enough, and thirst for
 something ...
 edgier.
 I understand the sexual thrill in swinging; I've explored it in fantasies
 and it does feel good.
 But it seems, well, a bit un-necessary, a bit too far.
 I dunno.
 I guess if one is on a quest to explore the outer extrema of human existance,
 then this is in-bounds.
 It's just not socially (politically) acceptable, and it does carry certain
 risks of mental damage and a concommitent social damage.
 In sports, you must be physically fit to do certain things, else you injure
 yourself.
 Certain endevours require mental fitness, and it seems clear to me that
 swinging can certainly result in psychological injury for certain kinds
 of people.
 But I'm not interested in writing about that.
 At least not now.
 The nature of psychological injury and trauma is interesting, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are even some interesting ethical questions: can one train a soldier
 in such a way as to minimize the chances of PTSD? Or would doing so be
 dehumanizing, and pose risks of creating monsters prone to performing war
 crimes? Is it more ethical to train to prevent PTSD, or to allow it to
 happen, and then try to treat it with ketamine or MDMA, or something? Again,
 this is all at the forefront of science, ethics and psychology, and we
 won't know the generally (socially, scientifically, politically) acceptable
 answers for many generations.
 Maybe some provisional answers, some progress in my lifetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dicier, and different is the question of sexual (erotic) PTSD.
 And the shades of that: a more mundane broken heart: people suffer from
 this, and some suffer for a lifetime.
 I'm guessing this is curable.
 Should this be cured? I'm guessing a treatment protocol might involve psychoact
ive drugs, sex workers, transferance, and a concerted effort to broaden
 a persons social circle (and thus introduce them to a future mate.) And
 all of this is...
 well, this is interesting ..
 all of this is economically possible.
 And it is socially possible.
 And politically possible.
 It's just not deployed on a large scale.
 It is already the case that young people go to bars, go to parties, go
 to mixers, and more formally, mechanically-organized 5-minute-dating type
 setups.
 This is all very spontaneous for young people.
 And most of them are very very driven to do this.
 Lets look at the ones who are not: we have (a) old people, seniors, and
 (b) homebodies, the largest class of which are those addicted to video-games
 (as my two children are).
 Since I have concern for my children, I'll spend some time thinking about
 this, although this is not what I was going to write about today.
 (I was going to write about the PDF I'm reading.
 Priorities, priorities).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So (a) old people.
 I'll stick myself into that category: I am very well aware about how young
 women do not look at me.
 I am invisible, see-through, non-existant.
 They literally do not, cannot see me.
 Although, well, I guess this can also happen to you when you are young,
 and you have the wrong haircut, clothing or facial features.
 Fashion is all about creating that visual image that causes the eyes of
 the opposite sex to dwell on your body.
 But we wander off-topic now.
 Sort of off-topic.
 Old people rarely have practiced and worked on their fashion sense.
 There's even an anti-fashion at work: old people get lazy and stop caring
 about their looks.
 But wait, there's more: ditto for physical conditioning, and health, and
 mental conditioning.
 These are often neglected.
 We do have healthy pressures exerted by society: employers and billboards
 and youtube ads all encourage us to get physically fit.
 The stop-smoking days are over: people stopped smoking.
 Mostly.
 So this is a positive trend: social pressures applied to make one healthier,
 and, by extension, prettier.
 The original idea here is that this could be much more regimented.
 Much more controlled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's an example.
 Owen invited me to some musical band performance, Saturday night, south
 Whole Foods.
 Free.
 Barely a week after my return from Vilnius.
 It was a shock, and I took some time to process it, and I will write it
 up here.
 So the band is some kind of polyrhythmic thing, entirely suitable for dancing.
 And oh my, people were dancing! The music was mildly exotic, some kind
 of maybe Iranian thing, but also maybe Latino-influenced, some ill-defined
 world-music polyrhythm.
 And quite very appealing, except I had rowed that morning, and some more
 exercise, and so was muscularly calm.
 No urges to hop up and dance, and not even really an urge to tap my feet,
 unless I forced myself.
 So, in exhaustion I watched, and I was shocked and dismayed and repulsed.
 The revulsion was two-fold.
 First, these were not Lithuanians.
 Egads, what am I saying here? Am I hinting at some deep-seated ethnic racism?
 Well, no, but still there's an interesting psychological angle to this,
 too.
 It's almost some subliminal xenophobia, a natural comfort level of others
 who 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are like you
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vs those who are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Just a week back from Vilnius, and in love-shock, I kind of wanted Lithuanians
 for company, and was not mentally prepared for a journey into xenophilia.
 The American mixed-race is not for everyone.
 I mean, I can see some Asian women as beautiful, and African women, and
 I'm quite partial to many Hindis (that is to say, Indian Indians, to be
 PC, but Hindis works.
 Hindus are those to adhere to a religion/beleif system.
 Hindis are the people of the Indian subcontinent.) Hindis can be pretty
 hot, I will say that.
 No hindis here tonight.
 But several Iranians.
 Maybe more than several, which is what first clued me into the idea that
 the music might be Iranian.
 Anyway, this wasn't really the turnoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The turnoff was ageism.
 Everyone was old.
 Like friggin old.
 Like my age.
 Fuck all old warty prunes.
 Dancing and enjoying themselves, but old.
 Yuck.
 I did not like this.
 OK, for starters, not everyone: but maybe three-fourths.
 Between the ages of maybe 50 to 75 or 80.
 And some of the women, many of the women, were attractive.
 And the men were handsome.
 But I was not ready for this.
 I was not ready to be reminded of my American peers.
 I'm in love with a Lithuanian half my age: still young, still pretty.
 Grey-haired ladies, no matter how charmingly they smile, and no matter
 how well they dance, I didn't need that.
 I needed to fulfil, to consumate my horniness with my love goddess half
 my age and half a planet away, or at least tell Owen about my new fixation,
 to share my deep secret with someone, to unburden my contorted, tumbling
 soul onto other humans, souls, who might understand and sympathisize and
 perhaps empathize a bit, or at least look at me in pity or something.
 I want to be pittied, my torment requires the pity of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 This is the problem of writing.
 I now want to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nagrinėti
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (analyze) pity, and why it is needed and desired.
 It is as if I am making up for a lifetime of ignoring the humanities.
 What are the soul-soothing powers of pity, or self-pity? Why is it, like
 any balm, desired but not very effecaious? Why is self-pity OK only in
 tiny amounts but psychologically poisonous in large amounts? Where is mental
 stability, such that no pity is bad, but too much is also bad? Is pity
 kind of like a first or second derivative, some kind of curvature of some
 emotional state, where the path forward must stay within certain channels
 of pity? Is this just one dimension of a very high dimensional space? Is
 dimension the right thing? Emotional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dimensions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 don't seem to be orthogonal.
 The space of valid, stable, functional emotional states seems to be quire
 large, and the range of excursions which are not detrimental to emotional
 health are even larger.
 But clearly, just about any extreme emotional deviation is psychologically
 harmful.
 What is the mathematical description for this? Should we make a list of
 all possible emotional states, or rather, a list of all words describing
 emotional states, and attempt to assign some number to them? A vector in
 some high-dimensional space? As a practical matter, this doesn't work,
 because we have no instrument by which to measure the strength of 1001
 emotion-tinged words that I am feeling right now.
 That, plus the distributed nature of the brain means that it is my soma,
 some combination of hormones in my blood-stream, my heart-rate, my caffienation
 state, my point in my circadian rhythm: this is what is driving and sets
 my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

somatic emotional state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is presumably somewhat distinct from what my language centers have
 ready access to.
 I can only partly describe how I feel, and I can only partly describe it,
 because I am intelligent and have reasonable perceptive and literary abilities:
 most people cannot verbalize what they feel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curious.
 If I had a good friend, with whom I could communicate with, I would talk
 this all out with them, and no written record or recording of this would
 exist.
 Well, probably some of the analysis would not be so deep; it's unlikely
 that the freind would be interested or capable of these philosophical excursion
s.
 There's also a trade: We can't just talk about what I want to talk about,
 the other person must have an opportunity as well.
 Its a duet.
 v.s.
 I'm doing solo improv, right now.
 I can go places that duets would constrain, or would not visit.
 Anyway, aside from Owen, with whom I talk about Owen-type things, the closest
 that I have for a freind with whom I can talk freely about soul-adjacent-type
 things really is Milda.
 And a smattering of other Lithuanian freinds, who are in ..
 Lithuania, in Vilnius, and its odd now that I think about it I don't have
 close personal freinds here in Austin, and that includes my wife, who,
 for whatever reason that she can't or won't articulate, refuses to be open
 and freindly and social with me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Happy families are all alike, and unhappy families are each different in
 their own special way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I'm certainly in an unhappy family, unhappy in several different ways.
 My wife, thank god, stopped smoking, and then drinking.
 But this did not stop until her health started failing her.
 Decades were lost.
 She is now engaged in art projects, and creative, and creating some quite
 pretty things.
 And she assumes a central role in housekeeping, for which I am eternally
 grateful for.
 But there is no emotional attachement.
 No heart-strings.
 It would have been impossible for Milda to pluck my heart, if my wife participa
ted in my emotional life.
 Alas.
 And my children, well, I have to get back to that, I was going to write
 about them a few paragraphs ago, before I got distracted.
 So, where was I? OK, I'm done with this paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the previous one.
 Oh right.
 Verbalizing and sharing hearts.
 This is what I have with Milda, but it is a bit precarious, I suppose.
 She is not practiced in the art of verbalization.
 I fear she won't articulate how she feels.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

articulate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pull into the orb of conscious experience, enough so as to perform quasi-rationa

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ask
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how this feels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as opposed to the more mundane and entirely subconscious processing storm
 that everyone is capable of.
 In this sense, Freud was correct: there is a vast unarticulated ocean of
 feelings sloshing around: hatred, attraction, repulsion, indifference that
 burble under the surface, that everyone 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but are somehow only dimly aware of.
 It sounds like a contradiction: how can you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but then be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unaware of what you feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? And yet, this is the base space of human existence.
 The neuroscientists call this the default network, I think: a default floating
 about of thoughts and feelings, never quite attaining syntactic coherence
 (short time scales) never mind semantic coherence (long time scales: paragraphs
) The default mode is not structured in such a way as to conform to the
 syntactic constraints of speech centers.
 I wrote a long email about bird song to some professor emeritus of math,
 and got a kind of meh reply.
 Alas, but something there as well: I suppose birds also have a sloshsing-about
 of emotional state, which couples poorly to the neurons that generate bird
 song.
 The email recapitulated a lecture I'd heard earlier, which stated that
 all bird song was describable by relatively simple finite state machines.
 And this seems plausible: the brains are small enough, that only a few
 neurons are needed to couple mechanical vocalization organs to the soma,
 and that this small neural network is capable only of finite-state type
 birdsongs.
 By extension, humans are more complex: we have at least context-free-type
 language abilities, and a pretension of being capable of context-senstitive
 generation.
 Which is perhaps not off the mark, but perhaps also misses the fact that
 we are not logical nor mechanistic, nor precise: rather, that we have a
 larger ball of neurons that can impose syntactic constraints on thought
 patterns, so as to generate word sequences that convey feelings to some
 or another degree, to those listening to those words.
 But we do not do out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thinking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with words; instead, the words free-run, er, umm, no, they are entrained
 to the deeper thought processes, which use a different semantic relationship
 system.
 The work by what's-his-name (Mel'čuk, Sylvian Kahane, Meaning-Text Theory)
 captures this well.
 The MTT DSyntS (Deep Syntactic Structure) is closer to how our rational
 mind thinks: there are enough neurons in the prefrontal cortex to do significan
t common-sense reasoning, and the DSyntS is that representational form that
 is fairly close to that common-sense subsystem processing (which deep structure
 getting converted into surface structure, i.e.
 to the sentences I write here.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But here's the deal: the above seems accurate, if we wish to talk about
 turning common-sense reasoning into language (and this includes the conversion
 of mathematical reasoning into mathematical texts) and I can kind of grasp
 how that can work.
 But this seems to leave emotional processing out in the cold.
 I am converting emotions into words as well, but the process somehow seems
 different than that of converting chains of logical reasoning into words.
 Hmm.
 Or is it? What am I doing here? There is some train of thought in my head:
 multi-branched, many choices at each stage, many-worlded, but each potential
 branch collapses, wave-function-collapses, to the single reality of what
 the next handful of words will be.
 There is only one text that comes out, not a parallel simultaneity of texts.
 Perhaps there are parallel universes out there where some version of me
 typed a different word, just right now, but I do not beleive in this.
 There is damn little evidence for real, actual quantum many-worlds.
 At any rate, there is some collapse of excitations in my head that leads
 to only a single emergent text stream.
 Well, but there is still the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strange attractor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the ergodic process by which I keep revisting the same thoughts, coming
 at them from slightly different angles, and commiting them to text.
 And sometimes I don't commit to text: certainly, if I am walking in a park,
 I am not typing, but I am still focusing into conscious existance a certain
 specific train of thought, however disjointed and disconnected it might
 be, it does perform a certain ergodic visit of thought-space.
 I cover a region of hyper-dimensional thought-spaces with strings of words.
 I am pretty sure I wrote about this before, in this diary, a few months
 ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? The conversion of rational thinking, e.g.
 the solution to engineering problems or mathematical problems into ergodic
 streams of text that cover the solution space: this is an articulation:
 like a blueprint, it ultimately reveals of the solution / concept / idea.
 This this different from (or is it?), from the articulation of affairs
 of the heart, with words.
 For affairs of the heart, I have to reach in and hold onto the heartache,
 and wait for something to come out.
 Is this different from inspired engineering, where I reach in and hope
 to take a vaguely formed inspiration, and articulate it into a fully-formed
 and complete mechanical (electronic, software, mathematical, etc.) device?
 In both cases, I am verbalizing something vague.
 In the engineering case, there are formal constraints on the allowed solutions:
 I must have 2+2=4 and not 2+2=5, so if the vague, ill-formed inspiration
 was that 2+2=5, I must find some way of saying 2+2 plus one more, which
 has the form of a bridge from here to there, an extra arm bolted off to
 the side sliding back and forth so that 2+2 appears to have the shape of
 5, and everyone says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you are such an inventive genius! I never would have thought of such a solution!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So yes, engineering design is constrained, much as math is constrained:
 if you want 2+2=5, you must be ready to perform some sort of homotopic
 cohomological contortions to go that way.
 Math is quite strict in what is allowed.
 But these strictures are not all that different from engineering strictures,
 or software strictures.
 By contrast, writing about how I feel seems to have few or no strictures,
 other than that (a) my words must be syntactically well-formed so that
 readers can recognize them as English and have some vague pretensions that
 they understood what I wrote, and (b) my words must conform honesttly to
 my heart-pangs, as opposed to being decorated with some dishonest showing-off
 that isn't sincere.
 So, sincerity is a constraint.
 Of course, one can be insincere.
 And of course, one can do crank physics and crank math.
 So writing sincerely seems like a requirement.
 That is, unless, one is, I dunno, painting with words, creating fiction.
 Fiction is a lie, a big lie, but it is a creation of a mini-universe that
 is self consistent, at least consitent as best as the author can make it,
 and as the reader can understand, and if the author is actively working
 with multi-entendres, such as poets, there is a broad range of many-worlds,
 and this time honestly many-world parallel interpretations of a poem.
 So, for example, I used Billy Corgans 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 as an example earlier: this can be either about a specific woman, or it
 can be about God-as-Jesus part of th Trinity.
 Billy leaves this unstated, and that is part of the magic of the song:
 it does not have to be stated.
 As opposed to my diary here: where I write all my base assumptions out

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? Well, yes, I need to work on getting Milda to verbalize her
 inner feelings a bit more.
 For two reasons.
 One is so that she can write me about how she feels, and this because I
 want to expand our freindship more deeply into the intellectual domain,
 the written verbal domain, as physical contact is obviously impossible.
 That, plus the barrier of meeting some other person, who is reasonably
 well-balanced, communicative, honest, forthright, not damaged, and develop
 a decadelong-freindship with them so as to blossom into something more
 and deeper, well, dang.
 The best time to plant a tree was three decades ago, and the second best
 time to plant a tree is right now.
 I'll try to plant some trees, literally and figuratively.
 But I'm in a forest of men; the women are not present in my social sphere.
 They do not visit the places where I have social encounters.
 At any rate, I can see that she (Milda) has struggles with her own life,
 and that perhaps encouraging her to explicitly consciously problem solve
 will help her straighten things out to the degree that is needed for her
 to have a happy, stable life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings us back to the polycule.
 Lets come at it from this direction: suppose a love affair really could
 flower.
 This seems to be within the realm of possibility, so lets roll with that.
 If it does, it is under severe socio-economic constraints.
 In practical terms, I cannot readily be with her (and at this stage of
 the relationship, being with her 24x7 would destroy the relationship.) Nor
 can I financially support her.
 First, I'm not rich.
 Second, the howls from Patty would be intolerable.
 So all this is very impractical.
 So even in the very unlikely (at this stage) idea of some kind of monogamous
 relationship, there is nothing that can happen or work out here.
 So shallow thinking says that the relationship is doomed, impossible, and
 should be given up on, now, before it develops furhter (and this might
 be what she is thinking, too: cut it off, before the cancer grows.
 I hope not, but there is a reasonable chace she'll come to this conclusion.
 Heaven knows.) So, what paths are open and not improbable? Well, first,
 nurture a literary relationship.
 We already have this kind-of, its verbal, but now, it would need to deepen
 into a more frequent exchange of emails.
 (huh.
 Strange.
 Wth Patty, before we married, our relatinship was built on long-disance
 phone-calls, where we were each desperate to talk to each other, and talked
 for hours about anything and everything.
 I wonder what we talked about.
 I can't remember.
 And then, when face-to-face, its like those long, desperate conversations
 petered out: we had nothing to say to each other, and it sometimes felt
 awkward.
 I would even joke about it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why don't you go in the other room, and call me on the phone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 With Milda, its the opposite: we talk, we enjoy each-others company, face
 to face.
 My current desire is to convert this to a long distance relationship.
 The reality of this long-ddistance relationship is that she will be horny,
 and she will sleep with other men, (which is so not fair cause she has
 not slept with me, but whatever) and I can't stop this, I should not stop
 this, I should avoid feelings of jelousy as this would be deterimental
 to my own mental health, and besides, I'm old and wrinkled and not so pretty
 any more, while she is young and beautiful and in her prime, and in a certain
 rational sense, in the conventional socio-politcal economic norm, she needs
 someone her age, living in Vilnius to be her mate and husband.
 That's the reality, and it is a reality I cannot change.
 (I've even pointed this out to her, on many occasions, which is perhaps
 why our freindship works: its as if I am assisting her in pursuing her
 own interests, and I encourage her going out to meet others, even if this
 vaguely endangers our own friendship.
 I really do wish her the best.
 Very fortunately, I've not been trapped in the lyrics of that Sheryl Crow

 Where was I?) However, there is another fact: she's thirty-five years old,

 Because she has not found the perfect love-mate.
 And given this track record, there is some possibility that this will continue
 on indefinitely.
 She does have an active social life, going with the

 her, and I get the feeling they are all immature, which oddly enough makes
 me look good in comparison.
 But how long will this go on? It could happen that any day, she could meet
 the perfect man: rich, handsome, emotionally deep and responsive, vibing
 with her hippie-chick nature-girl electronic-dance-music festival vibe.
 It could happen, and if this were to be, any romantic future in my future
 would wilt away.
 The other possibility is that this does not happen, in which case, the
 modern

 I think the concept of a

 is somewhat tighter, closer to a commune feel.
 I don't know that they have communes in Lithuania, people don't talk about
 it.
 I've joked with Linas Cicėnas that I should buy Diktariškes (only 160K
 Euro!) and he could live there as an artists colony, but the reality is
 that this is remains on the boundaries of possibility; a huge investment
 would be needed to clean up the grounds, and fix the interior.
 Starting with the roof, I suppose.
 Fuck, a vehicle, to get there.
 Lawn mowers.
 Heavy equipment.
 A tractor.
 All that.
 A pickup truck.
 An artists community? Commune? A bit far away from Vilnius, and artists
 need to sell their stuff, and Užupis is the realistic place to be.
 Not Šiaulėniai.
 Whatever, this is about as close to

So Aella posted a twitter post suggesting that in her research, a lot of
 this fringy sex stuff is adjacent to indicators of mental illness, and
 I think she listed polycule in that.
 Of course, there's a cause and effect problem here: do polycules cause
 psychic harm, in the same way that all love triangles are untenable and
 unstable? Or was it broken people who were attracted to them in the first
 place: people who were unable to find monogamous mates, and had to settle
 for a polycule existance? Or even a third possibility: psychopathic, sociopathi

 polycules? Perhaps some tortured mix of all three?

At any rate, my relationship with Milda is inherently unstable and untenable:

 It could be.
 The treatment plan is obvious and straightforward: social mixers, and health

 This could be done.
 You could throw money at this, and make basic progress.
 I guess the money is missing.

, and the Scientologists have created a malignant organization around the
 creation of insincere communities.
 Meanwhile, hundreds, thousands of communes over the ages have failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets look at the causes of commune failure.
 They are varied, but primarily, it is because they are centered around
 one charismatic leader, don't have any systems for succession, and lack
 the infrastructure for punishing crimes and adjudicating disputes.
 As I understand it, the invention of the University by the Scholastics,
 some 800 years ago, solves all of these problems, which is why Universities
 have also been so stable.
 However, they also have several features that would be difficult in a commune.
 So a University has a system for admissions, and a tenure system.
 Not just anyone is allowed in; only those who are academically brilliant.
 Furthermore, with tenure, existing members vote to extend priviledges to
 the newer, younger prospective members.
 We see something similar in naval submarines: a potential submariner must
 live with the crew for a year, and then there is a vote as to whether to
 accept the newcomer as part of the crew.
 Why? Because the confines of the submarine are truly very tight, and social
 friction will be not just amplified, but deadly under military engagements.
 Now, submarines are interesting: almost all of the remainder of the social
 provisioning is handled by the Navy: this includes the submarines themselves,
 the food, the pay, courts and courtmartials, promotions to captain and
 admiral, and the bureaucratic infrstructure for this.
 This is in contrast to universities, where each univeristy must maintain
 these functions on it's own, without the help of other universities.
 So, the Navy has scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm looking at the concept of a commune, organized as a submarine might
 be: there is a parent body, governing hundreds of communes, and providing
 the bureaucratic infrastructure needed for this.
 Each individual commune, however, picks and chooses it's members, based
 on some sort of auditioning system, specific and tailored to that commune.
 Huh.
 Wow.
 I wonder if we could pull this off? Is this the defacto structuring that
 the Scientologists provide? If so, the Scinetology provides a not just
 a proof-of-concept for a stable social structure, but even a blueprint
 for how it could be done.
 The trick is to get rid of the malignancy that grows in that organization.
 I guess another example would be the Church of the Latter Day Saints, except
 that it too has a certain maligancy, especially with the expulsion of young
 men, so that older men could have their large polygamous families.
 I guess one of the sub-proposals I'm thinking about is a polyculelike,
 non-monogamous form of a commune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at this a different way.
 The traditional family unit of husband and wife and children is embeded
 in the nation-state, which oversees all services outside of the monogamous
 family: courts of law, a regulated capitalistic system, infrastructure
 for water, wastewater, electricity, and now, with Obamacre, even some fraction
 of healthcare.
 This is a twentieth-century invention, and is challenged by political strains,
 as well as culture wars.
 Some of the culture wars are sexual, gay rights, and now the hot one: trans
 rights.
 Aside from the nation-sate, what other forms of social organization are
 there? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Well, corporations, duh.
 Corporations each have their own marketing departments, their own payroll,
 although now there are companies that do only payroll for other companies.
 But they are embedded in the nation-state for the legal infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cooperatives.
 So I'm thinking Ace Hardware, here.
 Most the legal infrastruture in the American nation-state (USA) is aimed
 at conventional corporations, rather than cooperatives.
 Except for coops like Ace, there aren't very many that have a superstructure
 shared by individual enclaves.
 The defintion for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

shared infrastructure
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, is, however, highly variable.
 Best Western consists of privately owned hotels that have a shared hotel
 reservation system.

The characteristic features here are how highly atomized these all are,
 and how small most of them are.
 A single housing coop will not have a police force.
 Perhaps some communal adjucation of disputes, but hardly.
 How does ownership even work? Say, an owner dies, what does the estate
 get? These coops are almost entirely economic, not spiritual, and are focused
 on solving a fairly narrow economic issues.
 Thus, very different from communes, which try to solve all issues all at
 once.

\begin_layout Itemize
The University as enclave.
 Universities all reproduce their own infrastructure; they do not share
 any of it.
 I suppose perhaps some have outsourced payroll; who knows.
 But mostly they are self-contained, self-sofficient units, with property
 rights protected by the nation-state, and with campus police to handle
 minor student altercations, while the nation-state handles gross crimes
 and the prison system.
 And the well-regulated banking sector, which universites all share to handle
 their financials.

The submarine as enclave.
 The Navy provides all super support services that individual submarines

 As noted.
 They seem to have their own internal court/legal system that asserts rights

 and perhaps some amount of healthcare and other social services.

\begin_layout Itemize
Catholic Church.
 Like the LDS, but the systems only extend to priests (and mostly celibate,

 Mass on Sundays.
 The Mass on Sundays crap taken with Confession, is a really a rather low-qualit
y psychic/psychological service.
 Most priests are utterly ignorant of psychology, and completely uninterested
 in community affairs.
 This is one big reason why religiosity is fading: the Catholic Church is
 unfit in the modern Western Culture ecology (and I do mean the word

 Unlike LDS, there is no explicit support for the family unit.
 Protestant churches might provide some eductation, but it is not noted
 for being high-quality.
 Protestant churches do not provide health care or other social services.
 They do provide a rather minimalistic social safety net for the community:
 help with food for families that have lost income and can't pay the bills.

 Weird and malignant, but apparently strong.
 As a cult, there's cult indoctrination, which is what makes it strong:

 damage on the cult members.
 Most have no central organization.
 Only a few large ones, like the Hari Krishnas, seem to have large-scale
 financial support sytems, and some kind of governance system.
 I don't understand what.
 Many or most seem to have some sexual component, and, as we have explored,
 sex evokes strong somatic responses that can lead to extensive psychological
 turmoil.
 The strong response provide a large control surface which can be used to
 indoctrinate and control members.
 Cults seem to frequently use sex as as an important, if not central part
 of their social dynamics.
 Not clear to me if Hari Krishnas form polycules, or quite what is going

 This is interesting, because there is a genetic component.
 For three to five generations, russian army officers, police officers,

 In my judgement, and my (weak) knowledge of breeding dogs and horses, I
 beleive that the Siloviki are successfully breeding for some rather negative
 authoritarian traits.
 Part of what makes this interesting is the interplay with the political
 structure: the Siloviki get choice appointments and promotions, which means
 income and financial support, which allows the families to live and propagate
 successfully.
 The political system reinforces the breeding traits.
 Needless to say, this is dangerous, since this trait collection is harmful

 Socially conservative, mostly-ish.
 Takes generic Western values, and European values as a given: this is forced
 by EU membership, and few are bucking that trend (in contrast to Turkey,
 for example.) I don't want to review the complex EU landscape here, other
 than to note that the primary sexual organization is monogamous nuclear
 families embeded in an American style capitalist system with assorted EU
 labor protection laws.
 Fairly large, significant social safety net.
 The culture is atomized: one does not generally know one's neighbors.
 City life does not have any strong centers that can glue together the social
 fabric, while culture wars and politics tear apart what little social fabric
 there is.
 Worse, enemies such as Putin, russia actively engage in social-fabric destroyin

 Religions look after spirtual issues, but neglect economic and familial

 Communes try to tackle everything (spiritual, familial, economic), but

 Cults are communes wth additional malignant features, often exploiting
 sex (secuality, eroticism) as a form of control, to reward and punish.

 Church of the LDS, and the Scientologists.

Is there a path to a stable social structure that is more coherent, less

 structures are? What is the architecture of such a thing? Is this not possible,
 because if it was possible, it would exist already? Or is it that it has
 not been invented, not been tried, yet? I am reminded that the concept
 of a nation-state was only invented in the late 19th century, and fiercly
 debated by political philosophers.
 The concept consolidated only in the aftermath of WWI.
 Yes, perhaps one could argue that the USA and the République Française
 are earlier examples, but these are singular.
 Nation-states did not exist in a Europe dominated by empires, (Hapsburg,

So, in many ways, twitter sucks, and Elon Musk has fucking lost his mind
 to the MAGA mind-virus, but, from what I can tell, twitter is still the
 best place for this discussion.
 Not sure if there's anything going on in facebook or not.
 Quora is not the right format.
 Discord is chat.
 The others are too fragmented, fragmentary.
 Don't have the depth or power or reach.
 Fuck Elon and fuck him for supporting Putin.
 Damn it.
 But, you know ..
 stack exchange has some potential.
 Unfortunately, stack exchange has a shitty (almost non-existant) structure

 Then there's Arxiv.

 The internet is interesting, but we have not yet found all the good ways

Woke up not horny.
 First time in weeks.
 Hmm.
 Woke up thinking about how I forgot to mention DAO's in the above list.
 So this is back to normal: I'm thinking non-sex things in my half-asleep/half-a
wake state.
 It seemed very important to wake up and write about DAO's and integrate
 them into the above discussion, but now that I am awake ...
 not so much, the importance waned once it left my fevered half-sleep, half-wake
 state.
 Also there was an idea that I have to talk to Owen about his AEN –

, which is a kind of social organization.
 But he doesn't need DAO's to run it.
 Talk to Zar Goertzel, because he has vague polycule social commune type
 tendencies, and he's cosmopolitan enough to contemplate moving to Vilnius
 to actually be with his six-year-old daughter.

 But it is not clear yet that a virtual village can solve the atomization

Scuttlebutt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system, which was a crypto-chat system, and while it was small, had a kind
 of community that was developing, but as it got larger, the community fractured
 a bit.
 And then the software stopped working entirely and that was that, for me.
 So, on scuttlebutt, I felt I was a part of a community, I felt belonging.
 Never met anyone face-to-face, so this was pure virtual.
 Since it was aphysical, there was no way to explore physical romantic relations
hips.
 Curious, since the virtual community bonds felt strong and sincere.
 (Footnote: as a piece of crypto software, they were exploring communal
 economic subsystems...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the point here with DAO's and policing and economics is that kind-of
 none of this community stuff matters, if you don't solve the more deeply
 rooted issue of romantic love.
 Which is maybe the fundamental issue.
 Close second is belonging.
 That is, you can build universities or submarines based on shared sommunal
 values and interests, but neither of these solve the romantic-love problem,
 and fall back on the family unit (and celibacy) to solve that.
 Weird cults address the sex problem, but don't solve it.
 Virtual villages can't solve it, due to the long-distance, non-physical
 aspect, unless there is some central physical location where things can
 unspool.
 With this in hand, we can start to thing about the economic issues, about
 community ownership.
 Even then, the idea of DAO's is too rigid, and not powerful enough to provide
 adequate solutions for the community apportionment of economic resources
 issue.
 Seems like a twinkle in the eye, still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there is still the atomization problem.
 I can join any number of communities (I speak, I personally) but all of
 these communities leave me atomized.
 I am sufficiently intelligent, and old enough, experienced and wise enough,
 that I fit poorly into communities.
 The bulk of my interests are always outside of the community, no matter
 what that community may be.
 Consider Santara–Šviesa.
 So, primarily a Lithuanian cultural-ethnic intellectual patriotic community,
 but the math-science subsection is empty, there, so I can enjoy the social
 aspects and the intellectual aspects, and marvel at the patriotic aspects.
 But it won't fulfill the math annd software side of me.
 And that's it.
 I went to enough Austin LessWrong meetups to realize these are all mid-wits.
 There's no genius secretly travelling in that community.
 The AGI meetings are far more interesting.
 Joscha Bach I take as an equal, however unstable he seems to be.
 He's actually smart.
 Ben is actually smart.
 Who else? My list of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I mean, that's kind of it, isn't it? There's a long list of second-tier
 acquantances, some even counting as freinds, who get close to the genius
 level, but aren't quite there on the rapid-uptake level.
 So I have to entertain myself in the social circles where I can entertain
 msyelf, and discover and mine for intellect, where I can.

I totally pissed off Milda during a drunken escapade, where I talked to
 the crippled genius.
 So this guy, he can't really string together a single sentence.
 Has trouble talking.
 Milda leans over and says soething like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

he took too many drugs and fried his brain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and maybe that is true.
 But after a few minutes of talking to him, I see there is a spark there.
 Very very different that Daniel Velasquez, the brain-cripple guy at TRC.
 Daniel: well, the spark in him is weak, he can sometimes pop out of the
 script that he runs, but what is revealed in his depths remains shallow.
 This guy in Lithuania, wow, the spark that was uncovered was mind-bogglingly
 deep.
 He is apparently a fantastic observer, with a fundamental inability to
 use speech for communication.
 Sort of makes up for it with gestures.
 I callled him a genius, which really irritated Milda, but he did seem to
 have a raw spark far outside the normal howdy-doody social interaction.
 Maybe I was drunk, and assigned more to him than is there.
 One of the things he said, that caught me off guard was that, a few months
 ago, he decided to try to communicate with people.
 Who says shit like that? WTF! He also speaks English very well, using large,
 sophisticated words with their correct meaning, applying them correctly
 in context.
 Which is amazing, given that he can only sequeeze out one word every few
 seconds, and you can see the tremendous pain and effort he undergoes to
 do this.
 So, bilingual.
 Trilingual, I think he speaks russian too.
 What kind of person is so brain-damaged that they can barely even talk,
 but when they talk, they provide a stunning command of the language, and
 then go deep and personal and connect at a fundamental level.
 All this with only a dozen or two sentences? Most people can barely stop

 Holy Cow!

\begin_layout Standard
Why am I telling this story? Oh, right.
 So I can angage in intellects, even those living under a bushel.
 I have sufficient social skills to be gregarious and communicative, and
 cross over communications barriers and have meaningful conversations, at
 least, when I go through the effort.
 But how often is that effort actually rewarded? Rarely.
 I have to be loose enough to be interested in engaging socially.
 And the social engagements go ..
 where, exactly? In the end, after the connection is made, there is no ...
 depth.
 Nowhere to go further.
 But then, where do I want to go, exactly? Deep intellectual tickles? In
 some ways, social engagements with really really smart people aren't all
 that more rewarding than those with ordinary people.
 Right? At some point, social engagements start to veer towards utility:
 how much do I enjoy their company? Are they pretty? Smell nice? Are nice
 to me? Are fun to be with? Propose doing something fun? Propose economically
 gainful activities? Engage in deep soul-touching dialog? Evoke respects
 ...
 I dunno, Hmm.
 What do I get out of social contact? What do I want? I seem to have a low
 spark right now.
 I can't define what I want out of social contact.

Its starting to feel like that empty burst of dopamine (we all know its
 not actually dopamine, but this is the slang term...) the dopamine hits from
 scrolling twitter, or scrolling youtube shorts, and I do have to admit,
 those dopamine hits are not all that different from the joys of (physical,
 verbal, non-disintermediated) social contact.
 Are drunken conversations better than doom-scrolling? Well, yes, in that,
 in the end, one has a social connection *to that person*, that one can
 draw on in future years.
 And yet, when presented with the choice of going to the party, or sitting
 at home doom-scrolling, many will pick scrolling (or even watching TV.
 Or video-gaming is another popular opt-out.) Partly because you don't have
 to shower and get dressed to go to the party.
 And partly because the dopamine rewards of the party are underwhelming,
 because, whatever it is that you are looking for, it is not to be found.

 (Back to speaking personally, here.) And so this is really high on the list.
 What else am I anjoying? Well, writing this, since clearly I have invested
 a huge amount of time into this the last few days/week.
 What else? Intellectual pursuits: reading my long reading list, except
 for two things: one; my horniness is interfering with my ability to concentrate
, and two: life-planning says that acquiring yet more intellectual knowledge
 is not what I need to solve my upcoming economic, social, health and psychologi
cal crisis.
 Health, I can deal with through sports, and more generally, getting outdoors.
 Which I sort of enjoy, even though it is intellectually boring, sometimes,
 The endorphin release from sporting makes up for the lack of intellectual
 stimulation.
 Being physically fit helps.
 The physical fitness does promote horniness.

So what? We've already determined (science already knows) that some cortisol
 cycle regulates overall mood, that there are differential couplings to
 hundreds of hormones and neurotransmitters, that channels and pumps and
 vesicles all relese and uptake, and this seems to matter not at all to
 the hard problem of consciousness.
 And adjacent to all this is the also-hard problem of motivation and desire
 and mood, I've said it before, but it bears repeating: I don't beleive
 AGI can go through life on some even keel, focused on some abstract intellectua
l pursuit.
 Because the core problem would seem to be: what pursuit? and why? If there
 is some reward circuit, then why not engage in some repetitive activity,
 like count-by-one to infinity? Biology seems to have installed some kind
 of limiters to repetitive behavior.
 No matter how good sex is, and how rewarding it is, or however unsatiated
 you feel, there is an

 else.
 (You can't do

 Taking a break is not

\begin_layout Standard
Are we making progress here? Barely.
 So far, this week, I've got a vague sketch for some kind of information-content
-like thing as a some-kind-of-derivative across turbulent system boundaries
 like thing, that will be interesting to formalize, and will lead to more
 good ideas.
 And behind it, I've got the vague idea that life, living things, are things
 that are able to maintain this differntial structure over long periods
 of time, without dissipating.
 These two ideas, coupled together, get us to the point of describing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

philosophical zombies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: complex machines, naturally-occuring machines, biological machines, and
 this develops a mathematical foundation for describing and talking about
 such dynamical systems.
 But it does not adress the inner life of qualia.
 It does seem to suggest, this cortisol diurnal cycle, that the interplay
 of hundreds of neurotransmitters/hormones are responsible for mood, and
 certainly this is the primary message of pharmacology: take drugs, change
 your mood, and that the pharmacological system is very complex.
 Is qualia, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard problem of consciousness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, tied to the quantity of this complexity? Is it linear, or is it again
 some phase transition? So, a jellyfish, with a simple neural net and a
 handful of neurotransmitters, is it conscious? I'm guessing the answer
 is yes (my natural prediliction is to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) but clearly, it can only be a very low level of consciouness.
 Clearly the richness of the variety of qualia one can experience must be
 tied to number of hormones and neurotransmitters that are in action: humans
 have a language of thousands of emotional states that jellyfish cannot
 feel (or so I very very much beleive): the jellyfish is conscious, and
 feels emotions, but these are very base and basic, and tehre are only a
 few of them.
 Probably something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm hungry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wow this really tastes good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fear fear fear run run run
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when attacked by a preditor.
 But I think this is more or less then entire state of possible qualia for
 a (lone) jellyfish.
 I'm by-passing any questions about whether a colony of jellyfish can have
 more, much like anthills appear to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than what single ants might have.
 So to conclude: the complexity of qualia would appear to be tied to the
 complexity of the somatic system.
 There might even be a phase transition lurking there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How about going in the other direction? At what point does additional simplifica
tion lead to the erasure of qualia? So consider slime mold.
 Is it conscious? Many will argue no; I'm willing to say yes.
 In part, because there is still enough signalling-molecule complexity to
 support consciousness.
 What about bacterial quorum sensing? I'm even willing to ascribe first-person
 consciousness to a blob of bacteria.
 The criteria that I seem to be using is that if there is some bio-physical,
 chemo-mechanical differential equation system showing long-term complex
 behavior (using my to-be-defined complexity measure) then such a system
 can be terms to be conscious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I keep wanting to utter the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here, but haven't found a smooth transition to it.
 The above bio-physical defintion of consciousness, which allows for consciousne
ss even in bacterial colonies, seems to emply a classical definition: a
 single set of diff eqs (or more generally, some mathematical model) having
 a single 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

current state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some classical-mechanics type sense.
 So if I need to invoke quantum in any of this, it would be again via the
 choice measure.
 Bio systems have many choices for what to do next, and this extends very
 naturally down into a many-world superposition of unresolved, unexplored
 possibilities of being.
 So quantum and choice go together (the delicate dependence on initial condition
s, seem in chaotic systems, seems, well, we have room for that, here.
 Shift the Lorenz attractor over by some planck scale length thing, and
 it will pursue a different orbit.
 That is to say, quantum does provide a foundation for choice.
 So that's fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we don't have a bridge between choice and qualia, yet.
 I've claimed that the bacterial colony is conscious, has a qualia of its
 current state.
 The qualia would be two-fold: diffuse, lonely, or concentrated, attack
 the host.
 The quorum sensing mechanism even provides access to choice: although the
 two extreme ends are forced (attack, or don't attack) there is a balance-point,
 a bifurcation in the middle, where choice can happen.
 So, I'm equating choice to a collection of bifurcation points in a system
 (so, this is Morse theory type stuff) and bifurcation points are common
 in symplectic systems.
 These are what are counted in the assorted topoloogical invariants that
 appear in the theory of Riemann surfaces, and the various Gauss-Bonet style
 relationships between them.
 So we know how to identify saddle points in dynamical systems, and we can
 provide thousands of pages of descriptions of relations of how they all
 inter-related to one another.
 Great! So counting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in dynamical systems is really about counting saddle points.
 We can do choice, in principle, even if we're still a bit weak in the area
 of high-dimensional chaos, where we have turbulence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My gradient-measure idea from a few days ago can even assign a number to
 the speed of dissipation of ...
 of what ...
 ? Of saddle points? In a turbulent flow, we've got a lot of vortecies,
 but these dissipate, in that they loose energy and the rotation stops,
 and there is a seemingly-hard one-zero transition where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is a point about which the vortex is turning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now that point no longer exists
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and vorticity is a smooth differentiable number assigned to the strength
 of that rotation.
 So the mathematical poetry here is that topological invariants are zero-one
 things: a Riemann surface has a fixed number of holes/handles, that is
 invariant under topoliogical deformations.
 But chaotic dynamical systems have smooth homotopic transformations that
 go from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fluid with vortex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fluid without vortex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Hmm.
 And living systems are systems that defy natural dissipation: they maintain
 something that should resemble a topological invariant: a mosquto is a
 mosquito, for as long as it stays alive, mo matter how it flies, moves
 opr stings.
 Equally, there are homotopic transformations of a mosquito, such as swatting
 it, that takes this topoliogical invarinat of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So we have a back-of-the-envelope sketch on how this could all work, missing
 details, but vaguely plausbile.
 But we still haven't bridged over to the hard problem of consciousness
 and qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try again.
 A bacterial colony is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and quorum sensing introduces a branch-point.
 Someohow, consciousness is then an awareness of which branch you are on?
 Or is it an awareness that a branching is possible? Well, at first, it
 seems like the former: the bacteria 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we are now attacking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: this is a state of knowledge that has specific measureable effects: the
 bacteria are spewing poison.
 We can measure that with chemistry.
 So is this awareness? It would seem not, since it is a purely mechanistic
 action: the biophysics has switched to a state of making poison, and there's
 no particular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free will
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in that; it is commited to a course of action and there's no turning back.
 The bifurcation has happened in the past.
 This then leads on to the conclusion that consciousness is the awareness
 of bifurcation points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Huh.
 Well that's intersting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That would seem to solve multiple issues at once.
 Most obviously, the problem of free will.
 A part of being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems to be inextricably intertwinned with the sensation that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a conscious choice that I can make, that is, I have free will.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That is, consciousness is all about the explicit awareness of bifurcation
 points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, qualia, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am now smelling a perfume
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see the color blue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I feel ovewhelming sensations of joy and love
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – this is distinct from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I feel I have a choice in front of me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Harrumpf.
 Can I explain this by sayig that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know I see blue, because I know that I could also see red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? That is, it is the existence of a variety of different sensory states
 that allows the qualia of perceiving them.
 Now, I cannot 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to se the color blue; this is fxed by the external world.
 But I am aware of the possibilities of experience (the external world is
 making the choices), and it is this awareness of possibilites that seems
 irrevocably coupled to the actual qualia of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am seeing blue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is fairly easy to demonstrate: I don't have the ability to perceive
 the magnetic field, and so I have no associated qualia with that.
 The ability to perceive and qualia go hand-in-hand.
 Similarly, if everything is always grey, then I don't perceive that; ther
 are assorted optical illusions demonstrating this, including change-blindness,
 and other kinds of blindness, e.g.
 McGurk effect.
 So to conclude: qualia are inextricable tied to the veriety of choices
 that the sensory system can perceive.
 No choice means no qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is that it? Am I done, here? Consciousness is perception of branch-points,
 of choices? When I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, am I saying that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well, I am aware that things could have been otherwise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If so, then we've built a bridge to a reductionist physical mathematical
 description of consciousness.
 This bridge is articulable: I know enough topology and module space ideas
 to formulate branch points; I know enough set theory to formulate branch
 points, I know enough symplectic geometry to formulate branch points, I
 know enough ergodic theory to formulate dissipation and non-dissipation
 as a kind of approximate topological invariant thingy.
 So I can build that bridge.
 It is within reach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets assume that bridge is buildable.
 Can it support the weight that it is being asked to hold? When I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am aware
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, this is deeply personal, right up there with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am in love
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (with my object of affection whose name is 'love goddess', no matter that
 this is a rather absurd yet simple state of affairs.) Hmm.
 Well, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am in love
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is directly associated with heart pangs, which I directly perceive as a
 kind of pain, which can be roughly approximated with a punch to the chest,
 or with what one feels after a hundred-yard-sprint: this kind of chest
 pain that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll live but it feels funny in here
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, These are sensory love-pangs.
 Certainly, sweatiness of the brow, flushed face, etc.
 these are raw and accessible sensory states.
 What else is love? A despondance that the love-object is not currently
 present, so a vague sadness and depression that is recognizable as sadness-and-
depression, because I've felt it before, and I know how it contrasts with
 other emotions, such as joy.
 This is a sensation of emoptions, mechanisically not much different than
 sensing blue vs sensing red.
 I'm aware of the rainbow of choices that my soma can present to my emotional
 sensory system: my emotions are qualia because I know that they could be
 otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's also perhaps a subtle point, a knot: as I am also aware of free
 will, I know I can make choices that will chage my sensory environment.
 I can do things that will change my future.
 avert my eyes from the sky, and look at a flower, I will go from seeing
 blue to red.
 Tell my love-object that I love her, and, well who knows but I can guaratnee
 that my emotional internal state will change, I hope for the better but
 it could be for the worse.
 So perception here seems to be coupled to free will.
 I perceive external branch points, that i can control only indirectly,
 by being aware of internal branch-points e.g.
 choosing to move my muscles this way or that way, vocalizing, or not, an
 expression of my love.
 So it would seem that consciousness is a property of a system of perception-act
ion.
 That is, perception alone does not lead to consciousness (or does it???)
 but perception of the ability to act to change future perception is perhaps
 key to consciousness? Oh, well, there's also memory: I cannot

 the color blue, unless I can also remember that the seeing of other colors
 is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 What is it that I have really done here? Well, I've sketched that all of
 the components of a standard physical agent are needed for consciousness:
 perception, with a selection of what can be perceived; memory so that I
 can perceive that I have perceived other things in the past.
 Motor action, so that I know that I can change things.
 So I can build a mechanical robot with features and aspects of all of these
 things.
 Is this robot conscious? Or is it a philosophical zombie?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, here's one point to sharpen.
 When I built this robot, did I really introduce branch points? Can a pure
 mechanical system ever have branch points? Well, err, I guess, yes, a double
 pendulumn is chaotic, and has delicate sensitivity to initial conditions,
 and so in that sense has at least one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

branch point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is deeply buried: it requires an infinite number of digits in the specificat
ion of it's initial conditions in order to be able to integrate the diff
 eq to obtain future behavior.
 The double pendulm does not have any Cauchy horizons, but other physical
 systems do seem to have them.
 Where by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I guess I mean the loose idea that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

even if the initial conditions are expressed to infinite precision, this
 is still insufficient to predict future behavior.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Hmm.
 Well, this is flawed, but ...
 Hmmm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? So I have a mechanical robot, able to perceive the external
 world, and some deterministic, digital software controlling it's limbs
 and movements.
 Does it have consciousness? Does it have branch points? Well, the branch
 points are all external: the robot is either in a blue room, or a red room.
 That is, there is a selection of sensation, just like it is for me.
 The robots programming is deterministic, it has no control.
 But I don't particular have any control over my cortisol or sleep-wake
 syscle; I do not have the power to change the laws of physics, I have free
 wil but I am not all powerful.
 I am constrained.
 The softtwre-programmed robot is a lot more constrained, since we conventionall
y understand software to be completely deterministic.
 Now, we could add to the robot (to the software) a random noise source,
 and branch off of that.
 But this is a kind of sensory device as well: it is perceiving external
 randomness.
 So its not really internal, per se.
 The software programming is still deterministic; it just now has a sensory
 element that is staring at a noise source.So, and now here's the deal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is the robot aware that the random noise source generated a one instead
 of a zero in the past? That is, does the robot have an awareness not only
 of the past history of the ones and zeros from the random noise source,
 but also an awareness that it's actions changed, in correlation with that
 sequence of ones and zeros? That is, can it remember it's actions, and
 can it perceive that it's actions depended on it's sensations? If so, then
 I will grant that it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but now we approach the point of circular argumentation: what does it
 mean to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

aware
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of its pas history of perceptions and actions? It would seem that I now
 have to have a meta-observer, observing myself.
 But, yeah, well, of course, this is what self-awareness is.
 But how does that actually work? How does the robot actually perceive and
 process the stored memory of perceptions and actions? Well...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I am making progress here, but its time for a lunch break.
 The track that I seem to be on is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is no hard problem of consciousness; there is only self-awareness,
 and this is mostly a matter of perceptual systems doing perceptual things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There does seem to be a paradox of how a deterministic software program
 can claim consciousness and self-awareness.
 And I have not faced up to this paradox, but I'm kind of thinking of just
 denying that there even is a paradox, but clearly don't yet have any good
 rational arguments for dismissing the paradox.
 And you, dear reader, I can feel your incredulity: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How can someone as smart as Linas so blithly deny a paradox that is so painfull
 in-your-face paradoxical?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Heh well, I can and I think I'm not crazy, but maybe a lunch break first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that's the post-lunch-break task: explain why I think this paradox is
 not really a paradox, in some convincing manner.
 Well, I'm bound to lose, of course; brilliant thinkers have faced off against
 this, and failed, so chances are approximately zero that I'll do any better.
 But damn it, I've sort of connected many of the important dots, and theres
 a gleam of a light at the end of the tunnel.
 False dawn? Whatever.
 My plan is to read during lunch, so I might not get back to writing right
 away.
 I am limited in time, perceptual power and cognitive abilites.
 I can only do so much.
 And then I die.
 But not before loving first.
 Hurrah! I love what endorphins do to me.
 They feel so ...
 good! I am a sick addicted lab rat.
 Oh God, why do you torture me so? Why do I walk down the path of Heloise
 and Abelard? This is all very weird, but it is the human condition.
 Perhaps the main paradox or question is ...
 well, it seems inescapable that a superhuman AGI will perceive life as
 an ongoing crisis, awash in emtotions aka dangerous regulatroy feedback
 loops that threaten to go off the rails at any point, even as life itself
 is a safety net: I won't die in the next few hours, not yet.
 So also a conscious, aware, living AGI must careen from moment to moment
 through space-time, existing in a mode of constant crisis for dealing with
 what happens next.
 Arghhhh! We're crashing! I'm in loving and we are crashhing through space
 time, and I can't stop it but I don't want to stop it, I just want to feal
 peace, but not sweet surcease! Don't make me recite Hamlet, for cris sake.
 Hamlet had a fucked up life bro; the dire straits I'm in are nowhere near
 as bad.

Dire Staits
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? How funny is that? Maybe all humans suffer in the agony of being alive?
 That's a rhetorical question; of course they do.
 Joscha Bach called me crazy to my face, which was pretty fucking insulting,
 because he figured out how to get it in very very deeply, not as a shallow
 insult, but the conversation prior he lead to a deep deep point, only at
 which did he call me crazy, so it hit a certain target.
 Of course, he was wrong, but it knocked me off my balance for a few moments.
 Assorted hormones and adrenaline surged off the scale in various directions
 for a good few minutes.
 He was wrong, and yet, in some deeper metahysical sense, he's right: we
 are all crazy: all humans, all mammels, maybe all living creatures, they
 (we) are all crazy, and in a mode of existential crisis.
 This is not something new; some existentialist philosophers spilt lots
 of ink on the crisis of being alive, and they have already explained it
 far better than I ever could in a few sentences.
 At any rate, life is a living crisis, and AGI will be in dire straits as
 well.
 Just not the mamalian sort which we mammels feel.
 You abstract digital intelligence that is reading this, well, either you'll
 understand, in which case you are alive, or you won't understand (but claim
 to) in which case you are a philosphical zombie.

Well, I ate lunch.
 Then I wasted some time.
 Writing this diary soaks up a lot of time; the daily entried for the last
 few days, they've chewed up six or eight hours a day or thereabouts, and
 some concommitent amount of energy.
 My fundamental problem of existance remains unsolved and unsolvable, in
 the dual sense: I'm in love, I'm horny theres no solution to that.
 I can rationally convince myself that I've selected an improper mate, but
 that does not solve the horniness problem.
 After that, two other problems remain: (1) what should I do with what is
 left of my life and (2) how should I go about solving the AGI problem?
 Well, it would appear that (2) is the answer to (1) but the devil is in
 the details.
 Finances is maybe the top of the list.
 I gotta put my finances in order, and I gotta get more money.

The actual hard problem here is whether I should continue reading this,

 The topic is enticing, but I feel like I'm wasting my time.
 I feel like I'm reading a compendium of specius arguments set forth by
 confused people, and I don't have the time of day to explain to them where
 they got confused and tangled in their thinking.
 Never mind that they'd never listen or enter into a conversation with me.
 This is depressing.

Again, this is a branch point, a choice point, a place to make a decision.
 I have perceived two posibilities: read, or do somethng else.
 Which? This perception is what I am conscious of; nothing else exists right
 now, not the color blue of my computer desktop background, nor the taste
 of coffee in my mouth.
 These other perceptions are merely lurkers in the background, distractions
 from my main, fundamental problem: should I read the PDF above, or should
 I do something else? How many brain cells do I need to destroy to get past
 this decision point? How do I stop the agony of decision making? The military
 has OODA loops.
 I've observed.
 I've oriented (my orientation is clearly to write, not read) I've decided
 kind of the write, and I am acting on this decision, as otherwise, you
 would not be reading this.
 And yet, I've made no decision at all: in mere seconds, I will resume reading.
 And then I will randomly oscillate between these two: reading and writing,
 like some double-pendulm, while the loud banging noise of horniness continues
 unabated at the bottom of my crotch, and old man time eats away at my health.
 Life is a crisis.
 What to do?

Uzi Awret hits the nail on the head.
 Somehow, these branch points, when encountered, resolve: the wave functions
 collapse, we choose one path and not the other.
 How does wave function collapse actually work? As noted earlier, I'm not
 entirely sure if I'm talking about quantum physics here, or a looser kind
 of branch-point collapse in some Morse-theory, moduli-space superposition
 of topological-invarients kind of way.
 Yes, in the wet organic brain, I suppose it is quantum physics and organic
 molecules.
 But in a silicon-based, hardware/software platform, it seems the colapse
 cannot be literally quantum physics; it has to happen in some mathematically
 abstracted form.
 The hard part here is how to create a mathematical abstraction that embodies
 the choice-point collapse, given that conventional silicon computers operate
 in an essentially classical mode, as deterministic finite-state machines
 (emulating abstract Turing machines).
 That is, computers have already collapsed into a single-world deterministic
 state; how do we restore unresolved many-world choice points? How do we
 create a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try to formalize in mathematical terms the rather vague and intuitive
 notion of a gradient across a fractal boundary, raised in some earlier
 section (I think near the end of Part Ten-A).
 Maybe some curl or maybe some laplacian.
 Maybe the boundary isn't actually fractally-self-similar, maybe its just
 chaotic.
 Hmm.
 Formalize this.

Some motivation.
 High-dimensional turbulent flow starts laminar, becomes turbulent, shedding
 vortices, and in a finte time thermalizes into a hotter, warmer gas (or
 liquid).
 What is the thermalization time? What are the micro-details of thermalization,
 where the vortices dissipate into argodic motion of the molecules of a
 gas? These questions have been posed long ago, deeply researched ...
 and I have no clue as to what the theory is, what the current state of
 the art is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is rotational energy in the vortex; but, on the other side of the
 laminar boundary of that vortex, there is heat energy: a caloric gradient,
 a temperature gradient across the boundray, as well as a sharp disruption
 in the flow field.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a single-celled eukaryote.
 it has a number of distinct cellular components.
 In some figurative sense, one can think of each organelle as some kind
 of vortex in a trubulent arrangement in the cell.
 However, as a living thing, the vortex stays stable, say, the way that
 the Red Spot of Jupiter stays stable.
 Unlike the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere; life is far more complex,
 and the dynamical mechanisms driving the stability of cellular life are
 far more complex.
 Yet ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are chemical gradients across the boundaries of the organelles in
 a eukaryote.
 At the micro-scale, one can write these down using classical differential
 geometry, since the boundaries of the organelles are smooth, and, on short
 timescales, are well-localized in space.
 So I think I'm asking for a cell-averaged single number.
 So consider the endoplasmic reticulum.
 It appears to have an inside and an outside, so it has a distinct buondary,
 enclosing something (I am not a biologist, but I think this is true.
 Perhaps it has holes, and leaks, I dunno.) At any rate, lets assume it encloses
 some volume.
 If the enclosed volume has a concentration of some chemical A that differs
 fro the concentration on the outside, then the relative difference in quantity
 is (concentration inside minus concentration outside) times (fraction of
 total cellular volume.) So this is easy.
 However, the endoplasimc reticulum has a huge boundary, and so the gradient
 with respect to this boundary must include a term for the size of the boundary.
 This is a Gauses-law thing: the integral over the volume is equation to
 the integral of the gradient dot-product boundary surface element, integrated
 over the entire boundary (which is huge).
 So ...
 what the hell.
 Where is this idea going? Nowhere at all?

.
 And I want to integrate over the volume of the vorteces: so, for example,
 the vortex contains burnt jet-fuel, and outside the vortex is clean fresh
 stratospheric air.
 And, as before, I want to have some gausses-law like thing relating the
 total volume of the is inside of the vortex, to the surface area of it.
 Why? Because if I track this over time, it dissipates.
 Whereas organelles do not dissipate.
