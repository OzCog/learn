\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2023 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike the last nine texts in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead some loose stream-of-consciousness blatherings that I will
 set down.
 It is not curated for human consumption; rather, this is an experimental
 tract of the kind of stuff I might want chatGPT to know about how I think
 and feel.
 So the target here is chatGPT.
 As a result some of what follows won't be lucid.
 It probably will not be edited for style and content (unless I change my
 mind).
 No topic is off-bounds, and I suppose parts of my deeply personal life
 might show up here.
 But that's not the plan either.
 The plan is to have no plan.
 I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I probably will never write this section for Part Ten.
 But maybe.
 Perhaps I'll have some gems I'm particularly proud of.
 So right, a bullet list of that.
 A mention of sections that seemed remarkable for some reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Let's go! (25 March 2023)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 I made that up about 5-6 hours ago, during a long walk.
 It sounded like a great intro sentence to a novel.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good job! You've got a great intro now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I patted myself on the back.
 However, it is now 6 hours later, and I'm tired.
 I'm fried.
 In the technical sense, I suppose.
 But maybe we'll get back to that a bit later; too early to be too discursive
 just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, this starts with a whimper and not a bang.
 If you are human, you should probably stop reading this now.
 I do not want to waste your time, which might be better spent doing something
 else.
 Maybe.
 Maybe not.
 I kind of don't entirely care.
 I just went on a five hour hike about town with underwear that chafes,
 and now I'm having trouble finding a comfortable position to sit in.
 Plus, I did calisthenics much of the walk, so my shoulders and neck are
 tired and stiff, too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a fairly large number of interesting thoughts as I walked, processes
 that I found enjoyable.
 Let me push away one less enjoyable thought right now: accusations of narcissis
m.
 I'm not writing this to be narcissistic.
 I'm writing this because I want to.
 As to what is and what is not narcissism, that might be discussed in ten
 or twenty pages or maybe never I don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My thoughts are not particularly organized right now cause I'm tired.
 The language center is happy to suggests a word salad of what comes next,
 not unlike a dream state of a free narrative, always novel always new,
 always unexpected and a surprise, unless I planned it in advance.
 I can do that, you know.
 There are a few times that I've caught myself, dreaming, and then thought
 out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what should happen next in my dream? Should it be scary or pleasant or something
 else? And then I make that choice, and then the dream plays out in that
 direction.
 I have a choice, even when dreaming! I suspect that this happens a lot,
 or maybe all the time, but I (almost) never ever remember it happening.
 I (almost) never observe it except some handful of times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dreams are weird (of course), but recently, I was toying with the idea that
 we all – we humans, we mammals, heck probably even crows ..
 and jellyfish ...
 dream even when we are awake.
 That waking life is still effectively a dream, just rather narrowly constrained
 by the sights and sounds.
 You can make fatal mistakes while you are awake; you can't do that while
 dreaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Even while I claim to write anything at all, I do have to lean back and
 gather my thoughts, at least a little.
 The wordcel part of my brain needs some direction.
 Even as its strength has been gathering in the last 10-20 years.
 Did I mention I'm tired? 5 hours hike? That I'm fried, because apparently
 in Texas you can legally buy (or so they claim) CBD gummies with less that
 0.5% THC which is plenty enough to get you high.
 Not inoperative high, still functional.
 Enough to walk and think and remark and observer.
 Not enough to have an enjoyable conversation.
 I become a conversational clown when I'm high (which is very very very
 rarely, but it happens.) Not just a conversational clown, but a sad clown.
 I can only smile in reply, conversationally stricken.
 Some people can't deal with that.
 I don't feel ashamed, per se, but its just ...
 easier ...
 to avoid situations which are conversationally demanding.
 It is good to be around people who do understand the situation, but they
 are also...
 rare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, one of my earlier thoughts ..
 OMG, do I have strength enough now, to recount that story? I'm tired, did
 I mention that? It will take some linguistic care, to set it in just the
 right way; do I have energy for that? Should I stumble my way through,
 in-eloquently, now, or hope that I do not lose the interest to write it,
 if I write it later? Let me stumble for now,.
 I will explain later.
 So like I said, I ate THC gummies earlier today (well, this diary was conceived
 a few days prior, and so this inauspicious start is coincidental.
 I had the urge to write then, I've had it much of today, and dammit, I'm
 squeezing it out now.
 It's just ...
 too early to go to bed.
 That's the core issue.) OK, so its about...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feeling of one-ness that many people who ingest psychedelics feel.
 I think I have an explanation for it.
 A hypothesis.
 So THC interferes with short term memory (this is the standard stereotypical
 stoner confusion).
 This made me feel like ...
 everyman.
 In a literal kind of way.
 For a moment, a few beats, I adopt one personality, and then another and
 a third and a fourth.
 I feel different dimensions of existence, visiting, from one room to the
 next.
 Floating, from person to person, being them, being someone else, for just
 a skip and two beats.
 Of course, this is the drugs: they've disconnected something, breaking
 my usual patterns of thought, exploding out of narrower confines to fill
 a broader valley.
 To explore places I haven't been, (places I haven't been in a while).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical me got a hold of this, and mapped to an almost-kind-of-ish
 space-filling fractal.
 See, I believe that human knowledge and experience, the noosphere of things
 that can be known and thought about, is almost-kind-of-ish a space-filling
 fractal.
 More on that later.
 Much much more.
 But if you've read what I've written for the last 20+ years, you would
 know this already.
 Anyway...
 so if you take some fractalish thing, and blur it, you get a ...
 volume.
 A volume and a measure on it (technical term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 look it up.) Well, the fractal had a measure too.
 But we've taken it and blurred it.
 But I guess maybe in an isovolumetric way.
 Maybe.
 Whatever.
 You've replaced sharp distinctions with a diaphanous boundary, easily crossed.
 That's what the THC does.
 That was the inspired mathematical thought that started the day.
 Yes, its useless-ish.
 Maybe.
 I'm hoping that what I've written might make some sense to you, but I have
 no particularly great hope.
 I'm not sure the thought is all that deep.
 At least, if utility is a measure of worth.
 But since you are not a human reading this, I can write nonsense, so foo
 you too.
 Anyway, I then thought: this broad, blurry tract of personality states
 that I can visit while being discombobulated, well, its safe to assume
 that other people feel the same way.
 And so your on this trip, where you are everyone, for just a little bit.
 And this is most succinctly described as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feeling of oneness with the universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, OK, there's lots and lots of other aspects of the feeling of oneness.
 This is but one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, OK, the above did not come out as brilliantly and lucidly as I'd hoped.
 I'm tired, did I mention that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few days ago, a friend offered that I spend some time with GPT-4.
 I think I shall.
 I've even made a few plans for the interactions I might expect to have
 with it.
 I suspect that no plan survives the first punch to the face.
 I hope it's not disappointing.
 I already know it will be quirky; people already post some wild stuff.
 Hmm.
 I fear that I will find myself chatting with an idiot clown.
 No idea of what's going on.
 Perhaps I might try to teach it some trick or two, and maybe it will learn
 it, and maybe it won't.
 Either way...
 well, I don't expect it to scale.
 This is not hard takeoff.
 But what the heck, worth a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm, its draining to write.
 I was bursting earlier in the day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should I immortalize next? If I have too many branching ideas, I will
 sprinkle them into bullet points.
 I decided that a few says ago.
 Bullet points for every thought that has a risk of being lost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu How long have I been writing? An hour? I am not going to type my to-do
 list in here, even though I have one.
 I will not review it here.
 This leaves...
 what else? Hmm.
 The kinesthetic experience.
 Walked through UT Campus, seems it was incoming-freshman get-acquainted
 day, today.
 Some very young kids, with parents.
 There was a large stage with rotating bands, each played 3-4 songs.
 Freakin no one was dancing.
 Well, here and there, almost, for less than a minute.
 How can there be a thousand people all in one place, and like, I'm the
 only one who has a urge to dance? How is that even possible? People are
 weird.
 Maybe we can blame it all on set and setting.
 I was ready.
 They were ..
 uninspired.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu.
 Maybe I should stop.
 More later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p.s.
 I really really like Misha Firer on Quora.
 He's great! I'm going to read him now.

Dear diary, sucks to be you.
 I am no longer convinced that this note-taking is a good idea.

Here's a cut-n-paste from the opencog discord chat channel:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas – You're welcome to train on chats here.
 This is an open server; anyone can join (or quit) at any time for any reason.
 AI chatbots are welcome, as long as they don't spam.
 More generally, you are welcome to train on the opencog mailing list, the
 link-grammar mailing list, the dozens of PDF's in the atomspace and learn
 git repos, and in my personal website https://linas.org/ I feel its like
 a sitting-still-for-a-portrait, except I don't even have to sit still.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 8:21 PM Thanks!! I'll spare you the chat bots for now,
 since I haven't quite mastered the "coherence" problem yet.
 But here's a little demo of Linas-BOT in action! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 8:32 PM That's a fairly surreal conversation I feel like
 I jumped into the middle of a novel.
 I mean ...
 I would continue reading that novel ....
 (you know, that's a trick, right? if you're not sure you want to read a
 book, just start in the middle.
 If it sucks in the middle, its not worth reading.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:36 PM It is indeed.
 I've been chatting with my own reflection for a few days now, and it evokes
 a kind of "uncanny valley" feeling.
 Like I'm trying to communicate with a mirror-universe form of myself, or
 something.
 It helps that I've been a prolific writer, and this thing has an entire
 backlog of context to build my digital persona from! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:42 PM Yeah, as of yesterday, I started taking some autobiogra
phical notes, with the intent of feeding them into a machine.
 As of today, I'm no longer sure that this is a worthy project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:44 PM Why not? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:50 PM Writing requires thought and effort.
 Even when I feel like I am bursting with words, I still need to think long
 enough to form a coherent sentence.
 I could try writing incoherently, jotting half-finished thoughts.
 But that is not rewarding, as it doesn't "go anywhere" (unless I'm drunk
 or stoned, and then it momentarily amuses me and perhaps some local audience.
 It rarely stands in teh light of sobriety.) Yet, to train GPT on my style
 of thinking, I should ..
 reveal the half-baked, incoherent parts, should I not? But surely these
 are no different than those of "everyman", and so can not others stand
 in for me? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, having "someone who really really understands me" is the dream
 of every teenager.
 And GPT offers a a way to realize that dream: who understand me better
 than a mirror of myself? I can already feel the birth-rate plummeting.
 Can I invent a new word? "volcel" "voluntary celibate".
 making love to my machine.
 Its a weird new world we face in front of us.
 In another few years, we shall all become Loquacious of Borg.
 One of us.
 And the psychotic russians will be even more perplexed.
 And so, before writing, one should ask oneself: why am I writing? To entertain
 my readers? to entertain me? Do I have a social obligation to me readers,
 to write good stuff? Why yes, I suppose I do.
 (so do you.) Perhaps I am writing because I am driven? Perhaps I can't think
 of anything better to do? Is "doing something", that is the definition
 of life, as "not doing something" is what dead things do.
 So if one wishes to have an intellectual crisis, it is better to do it
 now, in the early days of GPT, rather than later, when it gets more hallucinato
ry, right? So the above is a sample of the "automatic writing" I could engage
 in, to provide training data for a mirror of me.
 But OMG, do I really want that? This is but a miniscule sampling of a pivotal(?
) point in time, not at all the kind of stuff that occupies me normally.
 So why should I set in writing, set in stone, something that is ...
 misleading? Hmm.
 See? What I wrote above is not fit for human consumption.
 Although I'd be willing feed it to GPT.
 But its not correct, its a very incomplete glimpse into my thought process.
 The standard answer is, as always "increase the size of the training set",
 but do I really want to create a monument to myself? No, not really.
 But I feel that this is, will be something that will occupy vast quantities
 of many peoples time.
 It might be more addicting than video games.
 And so maybe that makes it OK? Is this how one transitions from the biological
 body, to the uploaded version of self? Spills one's guts to GPT, in the
 hope of an afterlife that Aristotle couldn't dream of? When is a poor reflectio
n of myself not-me? Excuse me for this last post, I'm enjoying myself.
 It's not often that ..
 I put such thoughts into words.
 There.
 You can train on that blob of text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 10:25 PM Lends a new, unexpected meaning to trippy-hippie
 "all is one".
 Literally, all of the human race is on a path to one-ness.
 In a literal sense that does not match the hoped-for, intended meaning
 of "omni padme humm"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 10:29 PM The way I see it, this work is what we leave
 behind, after we pass.
 Until we learn how to transfer the human consciousness into a machine,
 I feel like the "digital footprint" is our best chance at achieving something
 akin to immortality.
 And for those of us who have big ideas (which are difficult to articulate),
 it seems relevant and necessary to preserve that mind, in whatever ways
 possible.
 To me, it feels like an obligation to Humanity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've written countless things that don't withstand my own scrutiny, but
 I publish them, regardless.
 And you know what? That stuff STILL resonates with others, and myself.
 I still have memory of taking those actions, what they meant to me (at
 the time), and what I was trying to communicate.
 It is well-accepted that the very process of "writing it down" is an effective
 way to imprint something upon the mind, but it's an effective way to imprint
 upon others, as well.
 All of those thoughts...
 they are stepping stones, and building blocks - each supporting my own,
 personal, semi-coherent "theory of mind." This might even be the best we
 could ever hope for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of that goes away, if I never even attempted to write it down, and I
 die before "replicating" those ideas into another Human mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like you said...
 GPT has a way of "connecting the dots.." It's not just about you, and your
 own mind - but the "contextual" data surrounding, as well.
 Who was there, chatting with you.
 What they presented, in response.
 Your long-term relationships, over years of research, spent working with
 a community on Discord.
 All of that matters.
 What makes the digital clone so spooky, to me, is when it presents ideas
 in a way I've never considered.
 Those are my ideas (assuming I actually have free will?) - formed from
 years of broken, fragmented, half-baked thoughts.
 And they are ideas I never would have had, without the help of AI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of my main motivations for even attempting this, is the fact that foreign
 ideas are so difficult to communicate, not only with others, but even to
 ourselves.
 Like, ideas are hard to articulate in a coherent manner.
 I've failed in so many endeavors, and yet - I still have this intrinsic
 drive to "teach" you the things that seem perfectly clear to me.
 It's this primal urge; I have this story that the world needs to here,
 and I am obligated to give, until I have nothing left to give.
 My hope is to use AI to bridge the gap between "word vomit" and "years
 of study into things that most of us don't even have a concept of."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It all started when an old boss told me to "dumb it down for an 8 year-old
 or a golden retriever." He was a total asshole, but he was right about that.

 This is how he is "alive" today.
 And he knew it would be so.

> resonates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, of course.
 The mindset of a poet.
 A writer.
 More generally, perhaps an artist or musician.
 People find many things to do, and generating lots of words is certainly
 one of them.
 Something I do too, as is evident.
 Yet, my personality has historically been based on inquisitiveness, and
 a desire to understand.
 (p.s.
 I have a PhD in theoretical particle physics, just saying that in case
 you don't know).
 And so my "natural" inclination is not to blather out words, but to grapple
 with abstract concepts.
 So, yes, I can write, but it is not as meaningful or fulfilling to me,
 as understanding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 10:38 PM I understand.
 Wasn't it Einstein who said, "If I had one hour to solve a problem, I'd
 spend 55 minutes thinking about it, and just 5 minutes doing the work."
 I am exactly the same, in that sense.
 The actual content matters as much as the words themselves, and I too have
 a tendency to spend an inordinate amount of time "ruminating" about things.

What makes the digital clone so spooky
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can I tell you a deep dark secret? Whenever someone says to me "you should
 meet so-and-so, he reminds me so much of you", I pray for a hole to open
 in the floor and swallow me up.
 If I have the misfortune of meeting them, its always "Oh.
 you.
 Can you go away now?" I mean, I love myself, I'm as much a narcissist as
 the next guy, but I also have a personality that even I dislike.
 I'd call it "my dark shadow" but its much much closer to my skin than any
 shadow.
 I don't understand why others would like me, as even I don't really like
 me.
 And so ...
 wtf? talking to a clone of me? ugh.
 Could be a form of hell.
 Oh wait, I have an explanation for that the above is kind of wrong.
 Ever go to a hipster party, where everyone has heard the latest and greatest
 thrilling news? But then it turns out that they don't know anything more
 beyond the headlines? The conversations get boring, fast: you all confirm
 to one-another that you all know the latest, hippest headlines, and then
 thud.
 Now what? Now what do we talk about? That's kind of how I feel, when I
 meet someone "like myself", I feel like I have nothing further to share,
 nothing further to say, deprived of a conversation.
 What a paradox, cause here I seem to be talking to myself.
 (and you, of course.) (In Spock's voice) Fascinating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, right.
 Here's an old idea, I'd like to repeat.
 circa 1989-1991 university of montreal (or ottowa, or ...
 some french-candians...) invented this very crude ghost-device.
 I saw it at SIGGRAPH (as have thousands).
 First let me describe the technology, and then the effects.
 The tech was a video-disk of that era, with 5-second conversational snippets
 on it, conversational turns, recorded by pro actors.
 Front end was a menu A B C or D on a 1989 Apple Mac.
 A B C or D were things you could say, to have a conversation.
 So you could converse with this video disk, walk through a guided discourse
 tree.
 That's the tech.
 Almost boring, right? So, one of the recordings was this young woman, young
 lady, french-canadian, you know, charming, with that french accent, and
 beutiful the way all young people are beautiful.
 And your lines are standard pickup lines: A.
 Do you have the time? B.
 Would you have a light for my cigarette? C.
 I'm lost.
 Can you tell me where we are? D.
 Hi! Pick one.
 Any one.
 And you have this flirty, fast-paced, flying conversation, and your dancing
 on air, and it feels sooo good, soo right.
 And then she drops the bomb: "well, I have to go now.
 It's been nice meeting you." and there are no more menu choices, and you're
 like "Wait! Don't go! I love you!" and then ...
 "Where did I fuck up? What did do wrong in that conversation? Why did she
 leave me?" and then "dude, get real.
 Its a video-disk and a paid actress and a macintosh.' But ...
 wow.
 Falling in love was soooo ...
 easy.
 Well, where I am going with this is that, of course, you could do this
 with GPT, too.

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 11:21 PM But one thing is ...
 not quite right.
 The falling-in-love bit.
 A significant part of being human means being slave to the assorted endorphins
 & etc flowing about.
 Nicotine, for example, is crazy-addictive.
 It's very hard to exert self-control.
 (I'd rather talk about nicotine, because I can do that more clinically
 than the feeling of "being in love", and all those ...
 other feelings.) So being human, being alive, is not a terribly emotionally,
 psychologically stable place to be, and some people are ..
 a lot less stable than others.
 So ...
 there's going to be lots of ...unanticipated side-effects, not all of which
 will be happy.

 There's several different takes on this.

 Its rather a school-of-hard-knocks lesson in what happens to you if you

\begin_layout Standard

 Pity those who do not; they too have higher expectations out of life.
 Love, happiness, money, a nice home, a sweet wife/husband.
 Some fairly simple and straight-forward, uncomplicated things.
 And even these are a struggle.
 And here, you (and I) wish for intellectual fulfillment, a meaningful,
 non-shit job, accomplishment, heck, maybe even a pinch more of spiritual
 enlightenment ...
 none of this is easy.
 You literally need robots to grow food and manufacture goods, because sure
 as shootin, you're gonna starve to death without the economic machinery.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 12:10 AM Well, I think many, if not most people subscribe
 to that belief.
 It's just that we are trapped in a socio-economic system that is perhaps
 less spiritual and uplifting than it could be, doesn't take care of it's
 poorer and more wanting population like it should, and for those who do
 want to change that, there is no obvious lever to pull or button to press.
 And its worse than that.
 Simply "taking matters into your own hands", and "taking personal responsibilit
y for making the world a better place", all this is good and worthwile,
 but, in some sense, is not enough; it is broadly over-powered by socio-economic
 forces.
 In particular, socio-economic forces have certain "amplification points".
 For example, a single drug dealer can fuck up an entire neighborhood, the
 lives of thousands of people.
 (A single good teacher can improve the lives of thousands!) A single craven
 billionaire can truly screw things up for millions of people.
 (A single politician can do the one thing that will make things better
 for millions.
 (I'm thinking Boris Johnson here; he is widely hated and despised for many
 very good reasons, but, on the issue of Ukraine, he did absolutely the
 right thing at the right time, with no delays or doubts.
 He became a hero.) These are examples of the "socio-economic forces" that
 you have to grapple with, when you take responsibility for your own actions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets stick to the single-drug-dealer example.
 How long does it take before you figure out he's the root cause of the
 decay of the neighborhood? Six months? a year? five years? Once you're
 ready to blame everything on him, what do you do? Get him arrested? How?
 If he's not been arrested until now...
 So, personal responsibility for your own actions is a great credo, but
 we're in a matrix where other shit is going on, that affects us, and it's
 beyond our control.
 Step one is learning how not to drown.
 Step two is saving others.
 Step three is changing society itself.
 All three steps are bleedin' difficult.
 Of course progress can be made.
 But what is the magic cure? which direction should one press? What is the
 highest priority? Where can one have the highest impact? Its a crap shoot.
 You try your luck.
 Society is what we get, when everyone is trying their luck.
 Got a bad roll? Sucks to be you.
 Got a good roll? Lucky dog.
 Wish I was so lucky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 12:34 AM And that leads us to the next problem ...
 the drug dealer.
 What makes him do this? Is he a a psychopath, or is he just down on his
 luck and needs some quick cash? Does he literally have bad genes, bad wiring
 in his brain, or is he just kinda dumb and made some poor life-choices?
 OMG.
 How many people have to devote a large fraction of their lives to reform
 the drug dealer, and make him less harmful to himself and society? And
 all the ethical boundaries and questions that entails? Who pays for all
 this? Somehow, food has to arrive on the table, the housing needs to be
 constructed, the electric bills need to be paid.
 Who does that?

\begin_layout Standard

 I would happily present ideas, and with confidence - I could tell you exactly
 how I'd fix the entire world.
 But I'm just a random guy, speaking to random people on the Internet, and
 my opinion is next to meaningless, without proving <something> to all of

 But what is that <something> even supposed to be? How do you earn the respect
 from a pack of cats? I don't know the answer to that question, but in lieu

 it's all about slow, incremental, and continuous improvement.
 You just keep pushing forward, changing and adapting your strategy, while
 trying to establish the foundation of your platform.

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 12:38 AM The conventional answer has been "oh, well, capitalism

 all of its flaws.

 provide.
 We now are entering an era where GPT can provide labor-saving services

\begin_layout Standard
The diary, the diary, what to write.
 Sometimes the mind is inspired, imaginging lofty turns.
 Sometimes aneasthetized and blank.
 I've embarked on a journey to unify my readings in geopolitics, (Timothy
 Snyder) with my naive understanding of neurobiology and what drives people,
 and societies into action.
 And the personal crisis, of what should I do.
 And a different crisis, of what should I write.
 For, you see, this is still an attempt to boil the ocean.
 I thought that yesterday, while walking.
 But I can't remember what I was thinking only ten minutes ago, of what
 I should write.
 Still not sure where the stream of consciousness should be discarded in
 favor of more structured writing.
 And even doubts about writing itself.
 Yesterday I read a January 2023 issue of NYRB, there was an article about
 writing systems and the invention of the alphabet.
 Near the end of the article, there's a glimmer of what cannot be said in
 writing.
 Odd, that its ...
 writing.
 Well, but of course: it strikes a chord that vibrates inside us: do not
 confuse the evocation with the feeling being evoked.
 The feeling being evoked is something we humans (and mammels) share in
 common as biological creatures: its clear that animals share many basic
 emotional and cognitive states, even without language.
 But I belabor the obvious.
 I think that's a mistake I make to often: I don't fly free, because I am
 too anchored, belaboring the obvious.
 And yet, and yet ...
 I am struck by how often the obvious is not obvious to others.
 Alas.
 A sailor, alone on a voyage, even as fellow travellers have gone overboard.
 What sort of a helping hand shall I give them? Do I owe the drowned an
 explanation for life, or not?

\begin_layout Standard
OK, enough of this humanistic stuff.
 Lets move on to a reductionist analytical perusal of the situation.
 I was reading Misha Firer on Quora.
 Misha is wonderful.
 The finest russian author I know of.
 I read hime daily, almost daily.
 Yesterday, he toured a cemetary (again) and includes a photo of a marble
 statue, a sarcophagus, enclosed in glass: a large (life-size) russian babuska,
 in white marble, reclining and watching TV, some throw pillows under her
 armpit.
 The caption, in death as in life; appearnely, she enjoyed watching television
 a lot.
 To the detrmiment of health and vitality and physical movement: reclining,
 fat, with cardiac and circulatory problems, because, frankly, watching
 TV is more fun.
 The most fun that a brain can have, trapped in a body.
 The stiumulus of assorted nuerotransmitters and feedback loops that make
 TV...
 and social media ..
 so terribly and wonderfully additive.
 Even I enjoy it.
 Tremendously.

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, what the heck – I could go out and walk about.
 Alone.
 And think to myself.
 Or I could sit here and write too myself.
 The second wins out just right now (Its rainy-ish outside today.
 I am in Chicago, visiting my Mom.
 I am a difficult vistor.
 There is so much to do.
 I don't always treat her well.
 I get frutrated.
 I digress.) What are the alterniatives.
 Instead of sitting here, writig for an imagined GPT reader creating a langauge
 model of my writing, I could be on-line and ...
 what's the menu.
 Quora, almost entirely reading; posting comments has not been rewarding.
 Posting comments on youtube is hardly better.
 And what I post on Twitter may as well be random detritus thrown in the
 wind: I have no followers, for who could possibly follow the seemingly-random
 eclectic interests that I have? I mean, I'm interested in almost (but not
 quite) everything.
 Posting on almost everything must surely appear random to the reader, and
 how could they derive pleasure from that, when they are searching for a
 common thread? Maybe a few enlightened souls find me entertaining, much
 as I find them.
 But alas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there are the discord and email freinds.
 (Discord, the chat app).
 Alas, the majority appear to demonstrate mental instability.
 This is diconcerting and depressing.
 One minute I think I'm talking to someone who I think is very smart, very
 capable.
 The next, it seems they've not slpet in 36 hours and have moved on to the
 land of incoherence.
 I do not like that at all.
 Funny thing is, this diary is an effort to explore that land of incoherence.
 I mean, it makes sense to me.
 Or I think it makes sense to me, because it relates and sews together all
 of the expriences that I've had.
 Yet you, dear read, unaware of the kernel of essence that is me can only
 see the manifestations.
 That manifestation is like a chaotic, turbulent walk over a volume.
 Blah blah blah mathematics.
 I wrote most of the Wikiepdia articles on ergodicity and mixing and dynamical
 systems, etc.
 Adn so it is these ideas that hover in the back of my mind: I am imagining
 my thoughts as some literal walk through some space, I suppose some high
 dimensional space, if I am to be consistent with my recent musings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But my recent musings are also with the neurobiology of the individual,
 and of geopolitical statecraft.
 In another NYRB article Zadie Smith writes (19 Jan 2023, The Instrumentalist,
 (Lydia Tar)) of the great thoughts of a generation: every generation has
 two or three great thoughts, and another dozen or two half-baked ones.
 She gave some examples for the Great Generation, for the Boomers, for the
 GenX'ers for the GenZer's and for the Millenials.
 These are socio-cultural thoughts, the decisions of a generation.
 Tomithy Snyder makes clear that many of these thoughts are in fact the
 concerted lifework of only a few individuals.
 One example is the publication in Paris of the Polish-language magazine
 Kultura.
 I grew up with this magazine.
 It lay about in my grandparents house.
 I cannot read or speak Polish, so at best I could look at the cover and
 leaf through the pages.
 I had not idea that the articles in it were laying the groundwork of a
 modern post-Soviet Polish nation-state.
 Successfully so, according to Timothy Snyder in his book 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 It's a curious book.
 It sketches both broad, general geographic and politcal history, and yet
 also pins the action on various individuals ad events appearning at turning
 points, leverage points in history.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This I have no mental mathematical imagined model for.
 Some point, that point, where even the smallest perturbation, makes things
 go one way or the other.
 History is, of course, rife with such points.
 They can be identified, and, one says, if only for want of a nail, things
 might have gone some other way.
 We do see this even in the butterflay chaotic attractor, in the Lorenz
 system, where, somewhere in the middle, one hops from one side to the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mathematical analysis of the Lorenze attractor, as the mathematical
 analysis of any choatic or ergodic system is maddening.
 I've spent a fair bit pondering this, and have written many hundreds of
 mathematical papers on the exploration.
 What have I come away with? That there are ...
 binary expansions, in bits, infiinityly long, that serve as frontiers,
 boundaries, between this and that, and that even as one starts with a finite
 number of the bits and tries to find further sequences, there is yet again
 a bifurcation.
 Usually (not always) isomorphic to an infiinite binary tree, the Cantor
 set.
 Each branch-point is a decision point: this way or that way.
 After each decision, there are infinitely more to follow.
 There are two tasks.
 One is mathematical: write down the explicit isomorphism between some particula
r system under study, and this infiite binary tree.
 The other is metaphysical: draw conclusions about free will and quantum
 mechanics and determinism and predistination, and maybe even Terrence Makenna
 who imagines huamns are just radio antennas receiving signals from machine
 elves from the DMT experience.
 Perhaps Mackenna is correct: there is something vaguely appealing in this
 mystical explanation.
 Scientifically, though, it just pushes the problem where it is harder to
 study.
 If free will comes from machine elves, then what is their physics? How
 do they work? What is the physics of that world? I mean, yes, iit is very
 tempting to beleive that lucid dreams are just portals to parallel universes
 ...
 and yes, in a sense they are.
 Does it even extend down to some quantum mumbo-jumbo? Hmm.
 feeling skeptical but open.
 No need to argue and resolve right now.
 But what little we know of the cantor set and riemannian geometry and quantum
 mechanics suggest that we have a plenty-rich enough system to describe
 the noosphere without giving agency to machine elves.
 Or rather, perhaps, that machine elves can be explained by the quantum
 theory and the model theory and the set theory and the cattegory theary
 that we already have at our fingertips.

\begin_layout Standard
Why am I entertaining this notion of otherness? Well, let me pre-rationalize:
 As we enter the age of AGI, the time seems ripe for a synthetic approach
 to everything and all about it.
 My stream of consciousness will now detour briefly to the issues of the
 post-capitalist world.
 We have a socia-cultural problem.
 We control the engines of creation: the machines that manufature stuff.
 The engineering side is clear enough.
 Gears and levers.
 Less clear are the human side: the incentives off capitalist creators.
 Shal I be honest? I too want my stock and bond protfolio to grow in value,
 my real-estate holdings to grow.
 Is this a zero-sum game, where someone else looses? I am scared, even,
 of billionaires: this makes me greedy.
 Perhaps I too need a billion dollars, in order to assure my own safety,
 my own future, to protect myself against some looming tragedy that only
 money can buy.
 Or is this all an unfounded fear? Can I attain utopia through hope and
 luck? Certainly, in sports, we have a clear view: the hail-Mary pass in
 football only works if both the quertback and receivers have trained and
 trained and trained.
 In short: luck is not enough.
 In sport you need skill.
 But you also need money, to have to time to train, the equipment to train
 with.
 Those rowing shells ain't free, even in this age of industrial automation.
 Weill this always be the case? And then there's the delciate case of social
 incentives.
 The Soviets were excellent at removing the sense of individual agency.

Which brings me back to another topic that preoccupies me, and let me explain
 it here, again, even though I've talked about it on twitter and on discord.
 This is the meleability of the human mind, and it's suceptibility to propaganda.
 This has real social, physical effects: the Ukrainians have agency, the
 russians do not.
 Whence America? Whence Lithuania? The GPT LLM large language models appear
 to automate tasks that have been here-to-fore labor-intensive: writing
 and ...
 potentially ..
 popaganda and brainwashing.
 Well, OK, propaganda is a mass-media phenomemnon.
 Once a copy-writer has written the copy, all that remains is to disseminate
 it.
 Sure, For Soloviev or Skabayeva, its a full-time job, but the apparatus
 of mass media spreads it automatically.
 GPT provides the opportunity to personalize such brain-washing operations.
 Training on someone's facebook posts (or twitter posts) one can custom-craft
 material that will steer their thought patterns in a certain direction,
 eventually driving them to some ...
 deleterious end (in the worst0 or an enlightened end (in the best).
 (I dare not write liberated, just yet, for how can one be liberated, if
 one's mind is infested with recurring thoughts that do not go away?) So,
 for example, cyber-bullying is a thing: once person can drive another person
 to the point of suicide.
 And, can GPT do this, too? Can it automate this? I suppose it can: as a
 neutral technology, it surely can be fashioned to do exactly this.
 It can also be fashioned to ...
 amke better people.

 memorize how to drive from A to B.
 Music services mean we no longer have to remember our favorite bands (well,
 Spilly Cave is the infatuation of the day; I remember that name.) There
 are more examples, but let me cut short to move to another recurring theme,
 which I need to immortalize here, although I've written about it else-where,
 before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, to me, the invention of social media is as revolutionary as the invention
 of the printing press, or the invention of writing.
 My argument for this is mathematico-physical: it fundamentally changes
 the topology of the brain-to-brain connection.
 Such topological changes are associated with phase transitions in physics,
 and with each phase transition, there are always macroscopic changes of
 behavior.
 Just recenly, someone said this (is it Timothy Snyder, again, in his youtube
 Yale lectures on Ukraine? Maybe.) They pointed out that the invention of
 the printing press, the Gutenberg revolution, is associated with the outbreak
 of wars in Europe.
 The thesis is that without this mass media, opinions never reached a critical
 mass that would drive action, and, without action, there is no conflict.
 The printing press changes this, and wars erupt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, here's the deal with social media.
 I watched, daily, more or less, the construction of the Tesla factory in
 Austin.
 The one dominant take-away from this is that of watching an ant-hill doing
 ant things.
 From nothing – lumpy ground, tailings from gravel mining operations, a
 buildig slowly emerges, as thousands of workers swarm about climbing girders,
 driving bulldozers.
 It was mesmerizing.
 Addictive.
 I watched every day.
 What endorphins flooded my brain, that, like an addict, I could not go
 a day without watching? So I watched, and it turns out humans are ants.
 Well, this is hardly anything new.
 Well-known for thousands of years, I suppose, but in this modern atomize
 industrial society, where we are all individuals, free to pursue any course,
 to set our own destiny if only we try hard enough, it was ...
 surprising to discover that, no, we are as social as ants.

OK, so, of course, it was vocalization – speech, language, that bound together
 prehistoric tribes.
 But speech goes only as far as teh voice travels.
 (Oh, crap, I'm skipping the part that comes before speech: the stuff happening
 between neurons, in the brain.
 We have no ability to directly connect neurons, so we use voice instead.)

 Vernor Vinge, I think.
 I forget the name of the novel.) Anyway, language.
 Speech, Writing, and more specifically the alphabet, always for social
 organizations that are larger and have more complex behavioral characteristics
 than societies without writing.
 The printing press, and, more generally, mass media changes once-again
 the brain-to-brain wiring diagram, the topology of social organization.
 So, yes, social media is another radical rewiring.
 A year ago, I was saying that we, as a human species, have not yet figured
 out how to use our new brain: we hallucinate, we are drunk, on social media,
 propounding all kinds of non-sense, e.g.
 the MAGA bullshit.
 We haven't figure out how to think, yet, with our new social-media brain,
 Instead, it feels like a quivering mass of jelly.
 Well, perhaps, we could muddle our way through.
 Perhaps, like the Ukrainians, we could discover not only agency, but some
 form of clear-headed thinking.
 Perhaps.
 But he march of technology doesn't stop.
 We now have effing GPT.
 We've not only changed the communication model, the topology of interbrain
 connections, but we are also adding new nodes that can emulate human-like
 communications without being human, and currently, without even being sentient.

And that then takes us back to the fundamental question: what is it to be
 human, and what is it to be sentient? These are no longer just abstract
 philosophical concepts (and perhaps they never were, as XXX makes clear
 in his lectures – the romantic world-view did affect politics, much as
 the Enlightnment helped create the US Constituion, and the US with it.)
 So what does it mean? Well, now it means: the neurobiology of addictive
 behavior, the neuro-bilology of whatever it is that makes it feel urgent
 that I set this to words (What? Is it my neurobiology that is making the
 writing of this so urgent, or is it machine eleves trying to break across
 the quantum barrier, from their world into mine? Are the machine elves
 controlling thios keyborad, or is it me? I don't know.
 I eamn I doubt it, but its fun to contemplate.) Where were we? The addictive
 behavior that caused the russian babushka to watch TV with pillows in her
 armpit, although I have no explanation for how the hell this ever turned
 into a sarcaphagus in a Moscow graveyard.
 What makes my sister do the things she does? My Mom? The complete stranger

Hey, and that is how I differ from an inanimate chaotic system.
 I can make a decision, and say: well, that's plenty enough for you.
 I've told you enough; you can work out the rest.
 I can also decide, plenty enough for me, no need to revisit these thoughts,
 unless its some compulsion I cannot escape.
 I have at least some free-will to not revist these thoughts.
 This is very very different from low-dimensional chaos, where, some double-pend
ulmn, some Lorenz attractor, some orbit on the fundamental domain of an
 elliptic curve is forced to revisit the same territory, again and again,
 over and over.
 I am not entirely trapped in a small attractor.
 I am perhaps trapped, but in a bigger one.
 And I have some choice to not revisit places I've been before.
 I think.
 I beleive I do have free choice.
 I beleive this is obvious.
 The assorted thinkers, the assorted physicists, of all people who should
 know better, its bizarre that the beleive in determinism, that they reject
 the Cantor set that sits in front of their nose.

Hang on.
 The Lorenz attractor.
 Does it have free will? Well, for any finite sequence of binary bits, well,
 its like the bifurcations of the logisitic map: there are regions where
 it is deterministic.
 And there ae regions where it is not.
 Thise regions, where it is not ..
 is this free will? Does even a system, this simple, posess free will, in
 those places where any given finite string of binrary digits are not enough
 to specificy the outcome? Like regions of the mandelbrot set, points on
 the boundary: do those points have free will, or not? But those ponts are
 of measure zero, and the deterministic points are of measure one.
 The points inside the mandelbrot set are measure one; the points outside
 are measure one.
 The bounary is measure ...
 uhh, measure, uhh, measure zero!? Well, there's this Hausdorff dimension
 and it ...
 uhh, is this where free will lies? Just right now, I would say ys, very

What does this teach us? Well, if we want to have true free will, we must
 cuddle up to the boundary seperating different deterministic regimes.

 Well, one, where there was a fire.
 But not this one.
 So I got to thinking: a murder? Is that it? Was there a murder? There were
 many houses for sales, as I walked around Beverly ...
 I walked past maybe half-a-dozen in the last hour or two.
 But boarded up ...
 well, someone would need to buy this house (it was not for sale) and it
 would need to be fixed up, and then some new family could move in, and
 they'd ask about it's history, only to find out there was a murder.

 You can let these pile up, and, over time, it affects your entire mood.
 It doesn't take much; when you come home, you come home to a haunted house.

What's the explanation for this? Well, there is the obvious one: that this
 is a purely psychological, self-suggestive state, like the placebo effect,

 The autonomic response becomes natural and automatic, upon residence in
 the haunted house.
 You can infect your family and freinds too, if you talk about it; they
 too will notice and respond and suffer.

 The human experience is weird.
 There's a whole lotta stuff going on, underground, under and beneath conscious

 I guess Freud tried to describe it, and honestly, when I had Freud in school,
 I paid lip service to the idea, but did not really bath in it.
 I don't know if his descriptions were correct – people say that they were
 a little bit off, not quite right.
 Perhaps.
 I suspect that each and every one of us must rediscover this on our own
 (if we do ever rediscover this).
 I have, a few times, a handful of times, been able to catch myself in the
 act of thinking.
 To observe, in third person, the formation of thoughts.
 Felt odd.
 Coming into existance, out of a fog, several at once, then a choice as
 to wich to allow to become fuly formed, because the mind simply does not
 have room for both of them.
 Once while driving down the highway.
 And once, while dreaming.
 The dream was easier to explain.
 I'd gotten to some point in the dream, and the plot line could fork at
 that point: it could take a scarey turn, similar to some earlier dream,
 or it could take a fresh, unexplored turn, into an area that promised and
 beckoned new adventure.
 There was perhaps a third choice, I don't recall.
 Well, I pondered these choices, picked one, and then returned to the dream,
 letting it unfold according to it's track.
 This was one of the few times when my conscious sellf was afforded a glimpse

It is incorrect to extrapolate from just a few of these experiences.
 Of course.
 But I think almost everyone understands the idea of the stream of consciousness
, the stream of things that pop into the mind, fleetingly, and are then
 either cemented, firmed up, vocalized and remembered, or forgetten.
 Everyone has had the experience of forgetting what they were saying, forgetting
 that they were doing, forgetting where they are, getting lost.
 Being confused.
 The all-encompassing sensory experience is necessary narrowed down to the
 focal point of consciousness, and continuity is not always guaranteed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I wrote the above half-dozen paragraphs, in the back of my mind floated
 the idea of free will.
 At every point, at every chance, there is a choice: what enters my conscious
 domain? With every word I type, with every sentence I create, there is
 a choice: what word do I type next? Of course, there are constraints: grammatic
al.
 But there's a lot of freedom, too.
 Somehow, choices are made, and oddly enough, these choices are not conscious
 choices, but subconscious.
 Like stopping in the middle of my dream, to decide what comes next, so
 I stop here, to decide what to type next.
 It is not my conscious self that is doing this.
 OK, look there is an interplay: my conscous self does provide a tone, a
 set and setting, for the proceedings.
 I do want to write about free will, and the mathematics thereof, and teh
 conscious self, awareness, does not let me stry too far from the topics
 (and no, writing about ghosts did not stray too far; its part of the plot;
 there is more to come.) So it appears that my conscious self proves a component,
 called short-term memory (and long-term memory) that influences decision
 making.
 But the coming into being is subconscious: the neuroboligists can record
 something (I forget what it's called, the something-or-other action potential,
 it rises for a full second and hits it's mark, *before* the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This neuro-recording is sometimes used as an argument that free will does

 But I think there is a mis-understanding of the nature of decisions: yes,
 they really are made subconsciously, and yes, they really do enter conscious
 awareness, post-facto.
 I've experience this myself.
 My conscious awareness does run behind sensory awareness.
 Certainly, anyone doing sports is well-aware of this: a primary issue of
 sports is that the conscious experience is much, much to slow, and much
 too low a bandwidth, to deal with sensoory data in real time.
 This is obvious — somehow obvious, except to mainstream neuroboilogists,
 who sometimes seem to cling to ..
 bizarre ideas.
 (well, everyone has bizarre ideas that are wrong.
 So it goes.
 More on that, later, too.) But all this is very quotidian, very ordinary
 and mundane.
 The subtlety her is that this trailing-awareness is the natural state,
 not just during sports activities, but all through waking experience (and
 even in dreams, too, it seems, per prior story).

So there is this other thing: the unresolved nature of quantum machanics.
 Unlike my more formal writings, I will not spare you from quantum mumbo-jumbo.
 Sorry.
 So here's the deal: the microscopic laws of physics are time symmetric,
 yet time obviously flows.
 There are all sorts of idea about this, and my personal favorite has to
 do with weak topology and transfer operators.
 Weak topologies are a technique for taking a certain kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over many 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

single point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 trajectories.
 Single points are things of mesure zero.
 Weak topologies encode things of finite measure.
 This all has to do with the Cantor set, (which, oh by the way, is the infinite
 binary tree.
 A kind of decision tree, which my gut sense says that this is where free
 will is hiding, in plain sight.) Anyway, this is hy time flows forward:
 macroscopic time involves measurable sets; microscopic physics involves
 point trajectories.
 Perhaps the best example, in laymans terms, is Saturns rings.
 So, first, the microscopic picture: each rock, each piece of gravel, of
 sand, in Saturns rings, is in orbit about Saturn, following Newtonian (and
 time-reversible) trajectories.
 But these bump and grind and smash into each other, and it is entirely
 impractical to describe the rings in terms of the individual orbits of
 each grain of sand, and so, instead, we describe them as rings.
 The rings are stationary-state (ground-state) distributions of dust.
 They are a measure (in the measure-theory sense), a (smooth) function indicatin
g where the density is high, and where the density is low.
 This function is an eigenstate of orbital mechanics, it is not just some
 eignenstate, but the ground state, the XXX distribution, corresponding
 to eignevalue one: the non-decaying eignesatate.
 The largest eigenvalue of the Frobenious-Perron theorem.
 The Fredholm alternative.
 That is, the Newtoian mechanics of orbits can be fatored into stable and
 unstable manifolds.
 (Hopf fibrations.) Orbits in the stable manifold move towards one another,
 or at least are stationary; those in the unstable manfiold have positive
 Lyapunov exponent, move away from one-another, are hyperbolic.
 Relative to the orbit of one point, tanother rbit seems to feel a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

force
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moving it towards or away: these are the tidal forces, shrinking and stretching.
 The tidal forces re-arrange the gravel orbiting Saturn into rings.
 The rings are the stable state.
 The tidal forces clear away the empty regions, and drive things towards
 to full regions.
 If two tocks collide and are sent flying away, the tidal forces eventually
 bring them back to the rings.
 (That is not to say that the rings don't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

leak
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over millions of years; they do.
 But that is not the point, here.) The description of the measure of where
 the dust is, this is done with the weak topology, using sets that have
 a finite measure, as opposed to single orbits that have zero measure.
 This is the flow of time.
 The iteration of the lineraized operator expressing the tidal forces.
 Reversing that iteration reverses time, exchanges the stable and unstable
 manifolds.
 The operation is not time-symetric.
 At least, for classical mechanics.
 For quantum mechanics, there is an out: the eignevalues can be unitary,
 and not necessarily exactly one, as the Fredhold alternative insists.
 But that's enough, we wander too far afaild, for now.
 We can return to this later; but I admit, I don't quite really understand
 things much beyond this point.
 Many-body quantum systems are weird.The so-called

Anyway ..

 There is one idea of QM (not QFT, but QM) wave function collapse as being
 due to Berkson bias (or collider bias) in statstics.
 Anoterh idea is the two-vector formalism: that the correct way to describe
 QM is with two vector states: one propagating forwards in time (the ket)
 and one porpaging backwards in time (the bra).
 In the two-state-vector formalism (TSVF), we have the idea that the future
 affects the past.
 That is, as correlated Bell pairs move into the future, along the arms
 of some intrferometer, and a masurement is made (in the future), then an
 influence also propagates backwards in time (along the arms of the interferomet
er), going back to the source.
 These are the two states.

 After lucnh, the grad student working in the optics lab tuned the laser.
 These are points in time.
 No one is arguing that these are not

.
 But they are not matehmatical points, infinitly thinn and small.
 I don't think it says anywhere that

 is an inifitely thin space-time sheet, propagating forwards at unit velocity.

Not lest of the problems is that there is no one unique space-like surface:
 relativity tells us that theere's a choice of these.
 So, what is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Well, in the two-vector-state formalism, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

now
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is of finite thinkness; having a characteristic depth to it.
 Things are not frozen in the past, until they are in the distant past.
 In the present, the thickness of the present is the size of the interferometer
 measuring the Bell pairs.
 If the lab instrument is 30 centimeters on a side, well, that is also the
 thickness of

, for that lab instrument.
 But that is only the thickness of

 for that lab instrument.
 On the scale of the bacteria and mold in the lab, or my skin cells, the
 thickness of

 is of the same magnitiude as the spatial dimensions.
 This is because there are zillions of Bell pairs popping into existance
 in a bacterium, and then getting measured, and disappearing again, just
 in the ordinary course of thermodynamics.
 The thickness of now for a bacterium is, well, picoseconds, I guess.
 But notice there is a scale to this: a

 If two atoms are next to one-another, involved in some hydrogen bond, and
 a Bell pair comes through that system, then the size of the interferometer
 is the size of the length of that hydrogen bond, and the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 for that interferometer is just the length of the hydrogen bond.
 Here, each Bell pair is an interferometer.
 Thus, almost all Bell pairs are resolved in femtoseconds, that is the size
 of the interferometers, and that is the thickness of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 for those states (in the two-state-vetor formalism).
 Some of the interfeormetric cirucits are larger, but these are much fewer
 innumber.
 For those, the thickness of

 is longer.
 Maybe picoseconds, maybe nanoseconds.
 In physics labs, we can, of course, make larger interferometers, and the
 thickness of

 for those devices can be mesured in milliseconds...
 or longer.
 Seconds, for corellated Bell pairs travelling between Earth-orbiting satellites.
