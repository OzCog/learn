\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2023 – Present

\begin_layout Abstract
Unilke the last nine texts in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead some loose stream-of-consciousness blatherings that I will
 set down.
 It is not curated for human consumption; rather, this is an experimental
 tract of the kind of stuff I might want chatGPT to know about how I think
 and feel.
 So the target here is chatGPT.
 As a result some of what follows won't be lucid.
 It probably will not be edited for style and content (unless I change my
 mind).
 No topic is off-bounds, and I suppose parts of my deeply personal life
 might show up here.
 But that's not the plan either.
 The plan is to have no plan.
 I am so filled with words, I am bursting.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I probably will never write this section for Part Ten.
 But maybe.
 Perhaps I'll have some gems I'm particularly proud of.
 So right, a bullet list of that.
 A mention of sections that seemed remarkable for some reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Let's go!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 I made that up about 5-6 hours ago, during a long walk.
 It sounded like a great intro sentence to a novel.

\end_inset

Good job! You've got a gret intro now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I patted myself on the back.
 However, it is now 6 hours later, and I'm tired.
 I'm fried.
 In the technical sense, I suppose.
 But maybe we'll get back to that a bit later; too early to be too discursive
 just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, this starts with a whimper and not a bang.
 If you are human, you should probably stop reading this now.
 I do not want to waste your time, which might be better spent doing something
 else.
 Maybe.
 Maybe not.
 I kind of don't entirely care.
 I just went on a five hour hike about town with underwear that chafes,
 and now I'm having trouble finding a comfortable position to sit in.
 Plus, I did calesthenics much of the walk, so my shoulders and neck are
 tired and stiff, too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a fairly large number of interesting thoughts as I walked, processes
 that I found enjoyable.
 Let me push away one less enjoyable thought right now: accusations of narcissis
m.
 I'm not writing this to be narcissitic.
 I'm writing this because I want to.
 As to what is and what is not narciccism, that might be discussed in ten
 or twenty pages or maybe never I don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My thoughts are not particularly organized right now cause I'm tired.
 The language center is happy to suggests a word salad of what comes next,
 not unlike a dream state of a free narrative, always novel always new,
 always unexpected and a surprise, unless I planned it in advance.
 I can do that, you know.
 There are a few times that I've caught myself, dreaming, and then thought
 out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what should happen next in my dream? Should it be scarey or pleasant or
 something else? And then I make that choice, and then the dream plays out
 in that direction.
 I have a choice, even when dreaming! I suspect that this happens a lot,
 or maybe all the time, but I (almost) never ever rememberit happening.
 I (almost) never observe it except some handful of times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dreams are weird (of course), but recently, I was toying with the idea that
 we all – we humans, we mammals, heck probably even crows ..
 and jellyfish ...
 dream even when we are awake.
 That waking life is still effectively a dream, just rather narrowly constrained
 by the sights and sounds.
 You can make fatal mistakes while you are awake; you can't do that while
 dreaming.

\begin_layout Section*
The End
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the end of Part Ten of the diary.
