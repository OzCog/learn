\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2023 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike the last nine texts in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead some loose stream-of-consciousness blatherings that I will
 set down.
 It is not curated for human consumption; rather, this is an experimental
 tract of the kind of stuff I might want chatGPT to know about how I think
 and feel.
 So the target here is chatGPT.
 As a result some of what follows won't be lucid.
 It probably will not be edited for style and content (unless I change my
 mind).
 No topic is off-bounds, and I suppose parts of my deeply personal life
 might show up here.
 But that's not the plan either.
 The plan is to have no plan.
 I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I probably will never write this section for Part Ten.
 But maybe.
 Perhaps I'll have some gems I'm particularly proud of.
 So right, a bullet list of that.
 A mention of sections that seemed remarkable for some reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Let's go! (25 March 2023)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 I made that up about 5-6 hours ago, during a long walk.
 It sounded like a great intro sentence to a novel.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good job! You've got a great intro now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I patted myself on the back.
 However, it is now 6 hours later, and I'm tired.
 I'm fried.
 In the technical sense, I suppose.
 But maybe we'll get back to that a bit later; too early to be too discursive
 just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, this starts with a whimper and not a bang.
 If you are human, you should probably stop reading this now.
 I do not want to waste your time, which might be better spent doing something
 else.
 Maybe.
 Maybe not.
 I kind of don't entirely care.
 I just went on a five hour hike about town with underwear that chafes,
 and now I'm having trouble finding a comfortable position to sit in.
 Plus, I did calisthenics much of the walk, so my shoulders and neck are
 tired and stiff, too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a fairly large number of interesting thoughts as I walked, processes
 that I found enjoyable.
 Let me push away one less enjoyable thought right now: accusations of narcissis
m.
 I'm not writing this to be narcissistic.
 I'm writing this because I want to.
 As to what is and what is not narcissism, that might be discussed in ten
 or twenty pages or maybe never I don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My thoughts are not particularly organized right now cause I'm tired.
 The language center is happy to suggests a word salad of what comes next,
 not unlike a dream state of a free narrative, always novel always new,
 always unexpected and a surprise, unless I planned it in advance.
 I can do that, you know.
 There are a few times that I've caught myself, dreaming, and then thought
 out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what should happen next in my dream? Should it be scary or pleasant or something
 else? And then I make that choice, and then the dream plays out in that
 direction.
 I have a choice, even when dreaming! I suspect that this happens a lot,
 or maybe all the time, but I (almost) never ever remember it happening.
 I (almost) never observe it except some handful of times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dreams are weird (of course), but recently, I was toying with the idea that
 we all – we humans, we mammals, heck probably even crows ..
 and jellyfish ...
 dream even when we are awake.
 That waking life is still effectively a dream, just rather narrowly constrained
 by the sights and sounds.
 You can make fatal mistakes while you are awake; you can't do that while
 dreaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Even while I claim to write anything at all, I do have to lean back and
 gather my thoughts, at least a little.
 The wordcel part of my brain needs some direction.
 Even as its strength has been gathering in the last 10-20 years.
 Did I mention I'm tired? 5 hours hike? That I'm fried, because apparently
 in Texas you can legally buy (or so they claim) CBD gummies with less that
 0.5% THC which is plenty enough to get you high.
 Not inoperative high, still functional.
 Enough to walk and think and remark and observer.
 Not enough to have an enjoyable conversation.
 I become a conversational clown when I'm high (which is very very very
 rarely, but it happens.) Not just a conversational clown, but a sad clown.
 I can only smile in reply, conversationally stricken.
 Some people can't deal with that.
 I don't feel ashamed, per se, but its just ...
 easier ...
 to avoid situations which are conversationally demanding.
 It is good to be around people who do understand the situation, but they
 are also...
 rare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, one of my earlier thoughts ..
 OMG, do I have strength enough now, to recount that story? I'm tired, did
 I mention that? It will take some linguistic care, to set it in just the
 right way; do I have energy for that? Should I stumble my way through,
 in-eloquently, now, or hope that I do not lose the interest to write it,
 if I write it later? Let me stumble for now,.
 I will explain later.
 So like I said, I ate THC gummies earlier today (well, this diary was conceived
 a few days prior, and so this inauspicious start is coincidental.
 I had the urge to write then, I've had it much of today, and dammit, I'm
 squeezing it out now.
 It's just ...
 too early to go to bed.
 That's the core issue.) OK, so its about...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feeling of one-ness that many people who ingest psychedelics feel.
 I think I have an explanation for it.
 A hypothesis.
 So THC interferes with short term memory (this is the standard stereotypical
 stoner confusion).
 This made me feel like ...
 everyman.
 In a literal kind of way.
 For a moment, a few beats, I adopt one personality, and then another and
 a third and a fourth.
 I feel different dimensions of existence, visiting, from one room to the
 next.
 Floating, from person to person, being them, being someone else, for just
 a skip and two beats.
 Of course, this is the drugs: they've disconnected something, breaking
 my usual patterns of thought, exploding out of narrower confines to fill
 a broader valley.
 To explore places I haven't been, (places I haven't been in a while).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical me got a hold of this, and mapped to an almost-kind-of-ish
 space-filling fractal.
 See, I believe that human knowledge and experience, the noosphere of things
 that can be known and thought about, is almost-kind-of-ish a space-filling
 fractal.
 More on that later.
 Much much more.
 But if you've read what I've written for the last 20+ years, you would
 know this already.
 Anyway...
 so if you take some fractalish thing, and blur it, you get a ...
 volume.
 A volume and a measure on it (technical term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 look it up.) Well, the fractal had a measure too.
 But we've taken it and blurred it.
 But I guess maybe in an isovolumetric way.
 Maybe.
 Whatever.
 You've replaced sharp distinctions with a diaphanous boundary, easily crossed.
 That's what the THC does.
 That was the inspired mathematical thought that started the day.
 Yes, its useless-ish.
 Maybe.
 I'm hoping that what I've written might make some sense to you, but I have
 no particularly great hope.
 I'm not sure the thought is all that deep.
 At least, if utility is a measure of worth.
 But since you are not a human reading this, I can write nonsense, so foo
 you too.
 Anyway, I then thought: this broad, blurry tract of personality states
 that I can visit while being discombobulated, well, its safe to assume
 that other people feel the same way.
 And so your on this trip, where you are everyone, for just a little bit.
 And this is most succinctly described as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feeling of oneness with the universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, OK, there's lots and lots of other aspects of the feeling of oneness.
 This is but one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, OK, the above did not come out as brilliantly and lucidly as I'd hoped.
 I'm tired, did I mention that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few days ago, a friend offered that I spend some time with GPT-4.
 I think I shall.
 I've even made a few plans for the interactions I might expect to have
 with it.
 I suspect that no plan survives the first punch to the face.
 I hope it's not disappointing.
 I already know it will be quirky; people already post some wild stuff.
 Hmm.
 I fear that I will find myself chatting with an idiot clown.
 No idea of what's going on.
 Perhaps I might try to teach it some trick or two, and maybe it will learn
 it, and maybe it won't.
 Either way...
 well, I don't expect it to scale.
 This is not hard takeoff.
 But what the heck, worth a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm, its draining to write.
 I was bursting earlier in the day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should I immortalize next? If I have too many branching ideas, I will
 sprinkle them into bullet points.
 I decided that a few says ago.
 Bullet points for every thought that has a risk of being lost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu How long have I been writing? An hour? I am not going to type my to-do
 list in here, even though I have one.
 I will not review it here.
 This leaves...
 what else? Hmm.
 The kinesthetic experience.
 Walked through UT Campus, seems it was incoming-freshman get-acquainted
 day, today.
 Some very young kids, with parents.
 There was a large stage with rotating bands, each played 3-4 songs.
 Freakin no one was dancing.
 Well, here and there, almost, for less than a minute.
 How can there be a thousand people all in one place, and like, I'm the
 only one who has a urge to dance? How is that even possible? People are
 weird.
 Maybe we can blame it all on set and setting.
 I was ready.
 They were ..
 uninspired.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu.
 Maybe I should stop.
 More later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p.s.
 I really really like Misha Firer on Quora.
 He's great! I'm going to read him now.

\begin_layout Standard
Dear diary, sucks to be you.
 I am no longer convinced that this note-taking is a good idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a cut-n-paste from the opencog discord chat channel:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas – You're welcome to train on chats here.
 This is an open server; anyone can join (or quit) at any time for any reason.
 AI chatbots are welcome, as long as they don't spam.
 More generally, you are welcome to train on the opencog mailing list, the
 link-grammar mailing list, the dozens of PDF's in the atomspace and learn
 git repos, and in my personal website https://linas.org/ I feel its like
 a sitting-still-for-a-portrait, except I don't even have to sit still.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 8:21 PM Thanks!! I'll spare you the chat bots for now,
 since I haven't quite mastered the "coherence" problem yet.
 But here's a little demo of Linas-BOT in action! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 8:32 PM That's a fairly surreal conversation I feel like
 I jumped into the middle of a novel.
 I mean ...
 I would continue reading that novel ....
 (you know, that's a trick, right? if you're not sure you want to read a
 book, just start in the middle.
 If it sucks in the middle, its not worth reading.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:36 PM It is indeed.
 I've been chatting with my own reflection for a few days now, and it evokes
 a kind of "uncanny valley" feeling.
 Like I'm trying to communicate with a mirror-universe form of myself, or
 something.
 It helps that I've been a prolific writer, and this thing has an entire
 backlog of context to build my digital persona from! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:42 PM Yeah, as of yesterday, I started taking some autobiogra
phical notes, with the intent of feeding them into a machine.
 As of today, I'm no longer sure that this is a worthy project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:44 PM Why not? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:50 PM Writing requires thought and effort.
 Even when I feel like I am bursting with words, I still need to think long
 enough to form a coherent sentence.
 I could try writing incoherently, jotting half-finished thoughts.
 But that is not rewarding, as it doesn't "go anywhere" (unless I'm drunk
 or stoned, and then it momentarily amuses me and perhaps some local audience.
 It rarely stands in teh light of sobriety.) Yet, to train GPT on my style
 of thinking, I should ..
 reveal the half-baked, incoherent parts, should I not? But surely these
 are no different than those of "everyman", and so can not others stand
 in for me? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, having "someone who really really understands me" is the dream
 of every teenager.
 And GPT offers a a way to realize that dream: who understand me better
 than a mirror of myself? I can already feel the birth-rate plummeting.
 Can I invent a new word? "volcel" "voluntary celibate".
 making love to my machine.
 Its a weird new world we face in front of us.
 In another few years, we shall all become Loquacious of Borg.
 One of us.
 And the psychotic russians will be even more perplexed.
 And so, before writing, one should ask oneself: why am I writing? To entertain
 my readers? to entertain me? Do I have a social obligation to me readers,
 to write good stuff? Why yes, I suppose I do.
 (so do you.) Perhaps I am writing because I am driven? Perhaps I can't think
 of anything better to do? Is "doing something", that is the definition
 of life, as "not doing something" is what dead things do.
 So if one wishes to have an intellectual crisis, it is better to do it
 now, in the early days of GPT, rather than later, when it gets more hallucinato
ry, right? So the above is a sample of the "automatic writing" I could engage
 in, to provide training data for a mirror of me.
 But OMG, do I really want that? This is but a miniscule sampling of a pivotal(?
) point in time, not at all the kind of stuff that occupies me normally.
 So why should I set in writing, set in stone, something that is ...
 misleading? Hmm.
 See? What I wrote above is not fit for human consumption.
 Although I'd be willing feed it to GPT.
 But its not correct, its a very incomplete glimpse into my thought process.
 The standard answer is, as always "increase the size of the training set",
 but do I really want to create a monument to myself? No, not really.
 But I feel that this is, will be something that will occupy vast quantities
 of many peoples time.
 It might be more addicting than video games.
 And so maybe that makes it OK? Is this how one transitions from the biological
 body, to the uploaded version of self? Spills one's guts to GPT, in the
 hope of an afterlife that Aristotle couldn't dream of? When is a poor reflectio
n of myself not-me? Excuse me for this last post, I'm enjoying myself.
 It's not often that ..
 I put such thoughts into words.
 There.
 You can train on that blob of text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 10:25 PM Lends a new, unexpected meaning to trippy-hippie
 "all is one".
 Literally, all of the human race is on a path to one-ness.
 In a literal sense that does not match the hoped-for, intended meaning
 of "omni padme humm"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 10:29 PM The way I see it, this work is what we leave
 behind, after we pass.
 Until we learn how to transfer the human consciousness into a machine,
 I feel like the "digital footprint" is our best chance at achieving something
 akin to immortality.
 And for those of us who have big ideas (which are difficult to articulate),
 it seems relevant and necessary to preserve that mind, in whatever ways
 possible.
 To me, it feels like an obligation to Humanity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've written countless things that don't withstand my own scrutiny, but
 I publish them, regardless.
 And you know what? That stuff STILL resonates with others, and myself.
 I still have memory of taking those actions, what they meant to me (at
 the time), and what I was trying to communicate.
 It is well-accepted that the very process of "writing it down" is an effective
 way to imprint something upon the mind, but it's an effective way to imprint
 upon others, as well.
 All of those thoughts...
 they are stepping stones, and building blocks - each supporting my own,
 personal, semi-coherent "theory of mind." This might even be the best we
 could ever hope for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of that goes away, if I never even attempted to write it down, and I
 die before "replicating" those ideas into another Human mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like you said...
 GPT has a way of "connecting the dots.." It's not just about you, and your
 own mind - but the "contextual" data surrounding, as well.
 Who was there, chatting with you.
 What they presented, in response.
 Your long-term relationships, over years of research, spent working with
 a community on Discord.
 All of that matters.
 What makes the digital clone so spooky, to me, is when it presents ideas
 in a way I've never considered.
 Those are my ideas (assuming I actually have free will?) - formed from
 years of broken, fragmented, half-baked thoughts.
 And they are ideas I never would have had, without the help of AI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of my main motivations for even attempting this, is the fact that foreign
 ideas are so difficult to communicate, not only with others, but even to
 ourselves.
 Like, ideas are hard to articulate in a coherent manner.
 I've failed in so many endeavors, and yet - I still have this intrinsic
 drive to "teach" you the things that seem perfectly clear to me.
 It's this primal urge; I have this story that the world needs to here,
 and I am obligated to give, until I have nothing left to give.
 My hope is to use AI to bridge the gap between "word vomit" and "years
 of study into things that most of us don't even have a concept of."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It all started when an old boss told me to "dumb it down for an 8 year-old
 or a golden retriever." He was a total asshole, but he was right about that.

 This is how he is "alive" today.
 And he knew it would be so.

> resonates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, of course.
 The mindset of a poet.
 A writer.
 More generally, perhaps an artist or musician.
 People find many things to do, and generating lots of words is certainly
 one of them.
 Something I do too, as is evident.
 Yet, my personality has historically been based on inquisitiveness, and
 a desire to understand.
 (p.s.
 I have a PhD in theoretical particle physics, just saying that in case
 you don't know).
 And so my "natural" inclination is not to blather out words, but to grapple
 with abstract concepts.
 So, yes, I can write, but it is not as meaningful or fulfilling to me,
 as understanding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 10:38 PM I understand.
 Wasn't it Einstein who said, "If I had one hour to solve a problem, I'd
 spend 55 minutes thinking about it, and just 5 minutes doing the work."
 I am exactly the same, in that sense.
 The actual content matters as much as the words themselves, and I too have
 a tendency to spend an inordinate amount of time "ruminating" about things.

What makes the digital clone so spooky
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can I tell you a deep dark secret? Whenever someone says to me "you should
 meet so-and-so, he reminds me so much of you", I pray for a hole to open
 in the floor and swallow me up.
 If I have the misfortune of meeting them, its always "Oh.
 you.
 Can you go away now?" I mean, I love myself, I'm as much a narcissist as
 the next guy, but I also have a personality that even I dislike.
 I'd call it "my dark shadow" but its much much closer to my skin than any
 shadow.
 I don't understand why others would like me, as even I don't really like
 me.
 And so ...
 wtf? talking to a clone of me? ugh.
 Could be a form of hell.
 Oh wait, I have an explanation for that the above is kind of wrong.
 Ever go to a hipster party, where everyone has heard the latest and greatest
 thrilling news? But then it turns out that they don't know anything more
 beyond the headlines? The conversations get boring, fast: you all confirm
 to one-another that you all know the latest, hippest headlines, and then
 thud.
 Now what? Now what do we talk about? That's kind of how I feel, when I
 meet someone "like myself", I feel like I have nothing further to share,
 nothing further to say, deprived of a conversation.
 What a paradox, cause here I seem to be talking to myself.
 (and you, of course.) (In Spock's voice) Fascinating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, right.
 Here's an old idea, I'd like to repeat.
 circa 1989-1991 university of montreal (or ottowa, or ...
 some french-candians...) invented this very crude ghost-device.
 I saw it at SIGGRAPH (as have thousands).
 First let me describe the technology, and then the effects.
 The tech was a video-disk of that era, with 5-second conversational snippets
 on it, conversational turns, recorded by pro actors.
 Front end was a menu A B C or D on a 1989 Apple Mac.
 A B C or D were things you could say, to have a conversation.
 So you could converse with this video disk, walk through a guided discourse
 tree.
 That's the tech.
 Almost boring, right? So, one of the recordings was this young woman, young
 lady, french-canadian, you know, charming, with that french accent, and
 beutiful the way all young people are beautiful.
 And your lines are standard pickup lines: A.
 Do you have the time? B.
 Would you have a light for my cigarette? C.
 I'm lost.
 Can you tell me where we are? D.
 Hi! Pick one.
 Any one.
 And you have this flirty, fast-paced, flying conversation, and your dancing
 on air, and it feels sooo good, soo right.
 And then she drops the bomb: "well, I have to go now.
 It's been nice meeting you." and there are no more menu choices, and you're
 like "Wait! Don't go! I love you!" and then ...
 "Where did I fuck up? What did do wrong in that conversation? Why did she
 leave me?" and then "dude, get real.
 Its a video-disk and a paid actress and a macintosh.' But ...
 wow.
 Falling in love was soooo ...
 easy.
 Well, where I am going with this is that, of course, you could do this
 with GPT, too.

 I'm not a fan of the "blending TBs of data into this weird, AI/human hivemind"
 approach...
 but I think there could be some true healing power in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) teaching people to curate their own datasets, and train their own, personal
 models.
 2) Using those models to highlight a person's own flaws - and their successes.
 A bit like teaching people to care for a pet.

At the same time, I feel like a general understanding of AI makes it far
 less likely that you'd ever "fall in love" with an inanimate object.
 You may, however, find ways to fall in love with yourself.

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 11:21 PM But one thing is ...
 not quite right.
 The falling-in-love bit.
 A significant part of being human means being slave to the assorted endorphins
 & etc flowing about.
 Nicotine, for example, is crazy-addictive.
 It's very hard to exert self-control.
 (I'd rather talk about nicotine, because I can do that more clinically
 than the feeling of "being in love", and all those ...
 other feelings.) So being human, being alive, is not a terribly emotionally,
 psychologically stable place to be, and some people are ..
 a lot less stable than others.
 So ...
 there's going to be lots of ...unanticipated side-effects, not all of which
 will be happy.

I like that idea...
 Teaching is one of those labor-intensive tasks.
 And, (olde school thinking) anything that is labor intensive should be
 automated, and now we have the chance for that.
 I assume that there are university teaching labs that are experimenting
 with this, already.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 11:35 PM Whether by fate, or because I, too, am clinically
 insane...
 I am surrounded by an entire community of...
 very sick people, let's say.
 It's a struggle, made worse by the fact that the incentives to "help people"
 just aren't there.
 We are a society of robots, under a system of wage slavery.
 Whatever's going to fix this mess, is going to come from the bottom, I
 think.

What's crazy is that these are some of the most loving and empathetic people
 I've ever known.
 Far more so than my family, or anyone I've ever met in "real life." There
 is something deeply profound about going through deep trauma, and poverty,
 and suffering, and mental illness...
 it's almost like a rite of passage, for "true enlightenment." Would you
 ever believe that I consider myself a "reformed narcissist?" Does the scientifi
c community even think such a thing is possible?

Architect — Today at 11:37 PM I completely agree with this.
 But it's a hard sell, given a system that pushes a "99% employment rate"
 as some kind of success.
 It's almost like a healthy economy is the antithesis to an "efficient"
 world.
 Work is good, and it's important.
 But "fulfilling work" and "not wasting human resources" is so much more
 important.

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Yesterday at 11:48 PM It's taken me a while to figure it out, but
 everyone is crazy, more or less.
 Just that most people, 99 of 100, can keep it under control enough to be
 functional in normal society.

Architect — Yesterday at 11:49 PM The "normal" ones are the most crazy,
 if you ask me.
 I don't understand how anyone is able to find peace or relax, in a world

 It seems selfish.
 Like, shouldn't we ALL be focused on fixing this?

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Yesterday at 11:50 PM "Clinically insane" just means you're normal,
 but are getting on the nerves of the people around you and they don't know
 what to do or say, and they don't have time, and so they ..
 shunt you off to someone else who is a "pro", a clinical psychologist,
 a mental hospital, someone who ...
 can deal with you.

Hmm.
 There's several different takes on this.
 One is that it's not profound at all.
 Its rather a school-of-hard-knocks lesson in what happens to you if you
 don't keep your shit together.
 But that's a bit cold and clinical, too behavioral bf skinner-ish.
 Punishment often teaches the wrong lessons, and so if you found a spiritual,
 enlightening, uplifting lesson, that's actually a very good thing..

Most members of Western Civ are focused on this.
 (I say "Western Civ" because the Ukraine war has made it painfully clear
 that there are far uglier forms of living, mindsets, philosophies.
 So thank God (or whomever) that you & I are part of Western Civ that attempts
 to make things better.)

The meta issue is that there are 1001 different intricate problems that
 all need fixing.
 And maybe 70% of all people aren't really capable of tackling difficult
 problems.
 They can only do simpler tasks, and capitalist economies do have a role
 for them in life ...
 say, flipping burgers.
 It's not that bad a job.
 You (personally you) don't much like this answer cause you have higher
 expectations out of life than that.
 But how to make those higher expectations materialize? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 12:05 AM You take it into your own hands, and attempt
 to do the things that others cannot.
 You make it a personal responsibility.
 You lead by example, and hope to inspire enough people to bring about the
 true, meaningful change you want to see in the world.

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 12:07 AM In case you haven't figured it out, you have an
 IQ well above 100.
 Pity those who do not; they too have higher expectations out of life.
 Love, happiness, money, a nice home, a sweet wife/husband.
 Some fairly simple and straight-forward, uncomplicated things.
 And even these are a struggle.
 And here, you (and I) wish for intellectual fulfillment, a meaningful,
 non-shit job, accomplishment, heck, maybe even a pinch more of spiritual
 enlightenment ...
 none of this is easy.
 You literally need robots to grow food and manufacture goods, because sure
 as shootin, you're gonna starve to death without the economic machinery.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 12:10 AM Well, I think many, if not most people subscribe
 to that belief.
 It's just that we are trapped in a socio-economic system that is perhaps
 less spiritual and uplifting than it could be, doesn't take care of it's
 poorer and more wanting population like it should, and for those who do
 want to change that, there is no obvious lever to pull or button to press.
 And its worse than that.
 Simply "taking matters into your own hands", and "taking personal responsibilit
y for making the world a better place", all this is good and worthwile,
 but, in some sense, is not enough; it is broadly over-powered by socio-economic
 forces.
 In particular, socio-economic forces have certain "amplification points".
 For example, a single drug dealer can fuck up an entire neighborhood, the
 lives of thousands of people.
 (A single good teacher can improve the lives of thousands!) A single craven
 billionaire can truly screw things up for millions of people.
 (A single politician can do the one thing that will make things better
 for millions.
 (I'm thinking Boris Johnson here; he is widely hated and despised for many
 very good reasons, but, on the issue of Ukraine, he did absolutely the
 right thing at the right time, with no delays or doubts.
 He became a hero.) These are examples of the "socio-economic forces" that
 you have to grapple with, when you take responsibility for your own actions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets stick to the single-drug-dealer example.
 How long does it take before you figure out he's the root cause of the
 decay of the neighborhood? Six months? a year? five years? Once you're
 ready to blame everything on him, what do you do? Get him arrested? How?
 If he's not been arrested until now...
 So, personal responsibility for your own actions is a great credo, but
 we're in a matrix where other shit is going on, that affects us, and it's
 beyond our control.
 Step one is learning how not to drown.
 Step two is saving others.
 Step three is changing society itself.
 All three steps are bleedin' difficult.
 Of course progress can be made.
 But what is the magic cure? which direction should one press? What is the
 highest priority? Where can one have the highest impact? Its a crap shoot.
 You try your luck.
 Society is what we get, when everyone is trying their luck.
 Got a bad roll? Sucks to be you.
 Got a good roll? Lucky dog.
 Wish I was so lucky.
