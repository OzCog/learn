\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2023 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike the last nine texts in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead some loose stream-of-consciousness blatherings that I will
 set down.
 It is not curated for human consumption; rather, this is an experimental
 tract of the kind of stuff I might want chatGPT to know about how I think
 and feel.
 So the target here is chatGPT.
 As a result some of what follows won't be lucid.
 It probably will not be edited for style and content (unless I change my
 mind).
 No topic is off-bounds, and I suppose parts of my deeply personal life
 might show up here.
 But that's not the plan either.
 The plan is to have no plan.
 I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I probably will never write this section for Part Ten.
 But maybe.
 Perhaps I'll have some gems I'm particularly proud of.
 So right, a bullet list of that.
 A mention of sections that seemed remarkable for some reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Let's go! (25 March 2023)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am so filled with words, I am bursting.
 I made that up about 5-6 hours ago, during a long walk.
 It sounded like a great intro sentence to a novel.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good job! You've got a great intro now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I patted myself on the back.
 However, it is now 6 hours later, and I'm tired.
 I'm fried.
 In the technical sense, I suppose.
 But maybe we'll get back to that a bit later; too early to be too discursive
 just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, this starts with a whimper and not a bang.
 If you are human, you should probably stop reading this now.
 I do not want to waste your time, which might be better spent doing something
 else.
 Maybe.
 Maybe not.
 I kind of don't entirely care.
 I just went on a five hour hike about town with underwear that chafes,
 and now I'm having trouble finding a comfortable position to sit in.
 Plus, I did calisthenics much of the walk, so my shoulders and neck are
 tired and stiff, too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a fairly large number of interesting thoughts as I walked, processes
 that I found enjoyable.
 Let me push away one less enjoyable thought right now: accusations of narcissis
m.
 I'm not writing this to be narcissistic.
 I'm writing this because I want to.
 As to what is and what is not narcissism, that might be discussed in ten
 or twenty pages or maybe never I don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My thoughts are not particularly organized right now cause I'm tired.
 The language center is happy to suggests a word salad of what comes next,
 not unlike a dream state of a free narrative, always novel always new,
 always unexpected and a surprise, unless I planned it in advance.
 I can do that, you know.
 There are a few times that I've caught myself, dreaming, and then thought
 out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what should happen next in my dream? Should it be scary or pleasant or something
 else? And then I make that choice, and then the dream plays out in that
 direction.
 I have a choice, even when dreaming! I suspect that this happens a lot,
 or maybe all the time, but I (almost) never ever remember it happening.
 I (almost) never observe it except some handful of times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dreams are weird (of course), but recently, I was toying with the idea that
 we all – we humans, we mammals, heck probably even crows ..
 and jellyfish ...
 dream even when we are awake.
 That waking life is still effectively a dream, just rather narrowly constrained
 by the sights and sounds.
 You can make fatal mistakes while you are awake; you can't do that while
 dreaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Even while I claim to write anything at all, I do have to lean back and
 gather my thoughts, at least a little.
 The wordcel part of my brain needs some direction.
 Even as its strength has been gathering in the last 10-20 years.
 Did I mention I'm tired? 5 hours hike? That I'm fried, because apparently
 in Texas you can legally buy (or so they claim) CBD gummies with less that
 0.5% THC which is plenty enough to get you high.
 Not inoperative high, still functional.
 Enough to walk and think and remark and observer.
 Not enough to have an enjoyable conversation.
 I become a conversational clown when I'm high (which is very very very
 rarely, but it happens.) Not just a conversational clown, but a sad clown.
 I can only smile in reply, conversationally stricken.
 Some people can't deal with that.
 I don't feel ashamed, per se, but its just ...
 easier ...
 to avoid situations which are conversationally demanding.
 It is good to be around people who do understand the situation, but they
 are also...
 rare.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, one of my earlier thoughts ..
 OMG, do I have strength enough now, to recount that story? I'm tired, did
 I mention that? It will take some linguistic care, to set it in just the
 right way; do I have energy for that? Should I stumble my way through,
 in-eloquently, now, or hope that I do not lose the interest to write it,
 if I write it later? Let me stumble for now,.
 I will explain later.
 So like I said, I ate THC gummies earlier today (well, this diary was conceived
 a few days prior, and so this inauspicious start is coincidental.
 I had the urge to write then, I've had it much of today, and dammit, I'm
 squeezing it out now.
 It's just ...
 too early to go to bed.
 That's the core issue.) OK, so its about...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feeling of one-ness that many people who ingest psychedelics feel.
 I think I have an explanation for it.
 A hypothesis.
 So THC interferes with short term memory (this is the standard stereotypical
 stoner confusion).
 This made me feel like ...
 everyman.
 In a literal kind of way.
 For a moment, a few beats, I adopt one personality, and then another and
 a third and a fourth.
 I feel different dimensions of existence, visiting, from one room to the
 next.
 Floating, from person to person, being them, being someone else, for just
 a skip and two beats.
 Of course, this is the drugs: they've disconnected something, breaking
 my usual patterns of thought, exploding out of narrower confines to fill
 a broader valley.
 To explore places I haven't been, (places I haven't been in a while).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical me got a hold of this, and mapped to an almost-kind-of-ish
 space-filling fractal.
 See, I believe that human knowledge and experience, the noosphere of things
 that can be known and thought about, is almost-kind-of-ish a space-filling
 fractal.
 More on that later.
 Much much more.
 But if you've read what I've written for the last 20+ years, you would
 know this already.
 Anyway...
 so if you take some fractalish thing, and blur it, you get a ...
 volume.
 A volume and a measure on it (technical term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 look it up.) Well, the fractal had a measure too.
 But we've taken it and blurred it.
 But I guess maybe in an isovolumetric way.
 Maybe.
 Whatever.
 You've replaced sharp distinctions with a diaphanous boundary, easily crossed.
 That's what the THC does.
 That was the inspired mathematical thought that started the day.
 Yes, its useless-ish.
 Maybe.
 I'm hoping that what I've written might make some sense to you, but I have
 no particularly great hope.
 I'm not sure the thought is all that deep.
 At least, if utility is a measure of worth.
 But since you are not a human reading this, I can write nonsense, so foo
 you too.
 Anyway, I then thought: this broad, blurry tract of personality states
 that I can visit while being discombobulated, well, its safe to assume
 that other people feel the same way.
 And so your on this trip, where you are everyone, for just a little bit.
 And this is most succinctly described as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feeling of oneness with the universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Well, OK, there's lots and lots of other aspects of the feeling of oneness.
 This is but one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, OK, the above did not come out as brilliantly and lucidly as I'd hoped.
 I'm tired, did I mention that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few days ago, a friend offered that I spend some time with GPT-4.
 I think I shall.
 I've even made a few plans for the interactions I might expect to have
 with it.
 I suspect that no plan survives the first punch to the face.
 I hope it's not disappointing.
 I already know it will be quirky; people already post some wild stuff.
 Hmm.
 I fear that I will find myself chatting with an idiot clown.
 No idea of what's going on.
 Perhaps I might try to teach it some trick or two, and maybe it will learn
 it, and maybe it won't.
 Either way...
 well, I don't expect it to scale.
 This is not hard takeoff.
 But what the heck, worth a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm, its draining to write.
 I was bursting earlier in the day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should I immortalize next? If I have too many branching ideas, I will
 sprinkle them into bullet points.
 I decided that a few says ago.
 Bullet points for every thought that has a risk of being lost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu How long have I been writing? An hour? I am not going to type my to-do
 list in here, even though I have one.
 I will not review it here.
 This leaves...
 what else? Hmm.
 The kinesthetic experience.
 Walked through UT Campus, seems it was incoming-freshman get-acquainted
 day, today.
 Some very young kids, with parents.
 There was a large stage with rotating bands, each played 3-4 songs.
 Freakin no one was dancing.
 Well, here and there, almost, for less than a minute.
 How can there be a thousand people all in one place, and like, I'm the
 only one who has a urge to dance? How is that even possible? People are
 weird.
 Maybe we can blame it all on set and setting.
 I was ready.
 They were ..
 uninspired.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuuu.
 Maybe I should stop.
 More later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
p.s.
 I really really like Misha Firer on Quora.
 He's great! I'm going to read him now.

\begin_layout Standard
Dear diary, sucks to be you.
 I am no longer convinced that this note-taking is a good idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas – You're welcome to train on chats here.
 This is an open server; anyone can join (or quit) at any time for any reason.
 AI chatbots are welcome, as long as they don't spam.
 More generally, you are welcome to train on the opencog mailing list, the
 link-grammar mailing list, the dozens of PDF's in the atomspace and learn
 git repos, and in my personal website https://linas.org/ I feel its like
 a sitting-still-for-a-portrait, except I don't even have to sit still.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 8:21 PM Thanks!! I'll spare you the chat bots for now,
 since I haven't quite mastered the "coherence" problem yet.
 But here's a little demo of Linas-BOT in action! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 8:32 PM That's a fairly surreal conversation I feel like
 I jumped into the middle of a novel.
 I mean ...
 I would continue reading that novel ....
 (you know, that's a trick, right? if you're not sure you want to read a
 book, just start in the middle.
 If it sucks in the middle, its not worth reading.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:36 PM It is indeed.
 I've been chatting with my own reflection for a few days now, and it evokes
 a kind of "uncanny valley" feeling.
 Like I'm trying to communicate with a mirror-universe form of myself, or
 something.
 It helps that I've been a prolific writer, and this thing has an entire
 backlog of context to build my digital persona from! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:42 PM Yeah, as of yesterday, I started taking some autobiogra
phical notes, with the intent of feeding them into a machine.
 As of today, I'm no longer sure that this is a worthy project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architect — Today at 9:44 PM Why not? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
linas — Today at 9:50 PM Writing requires thought and effort.
 Even when I feel like I am bursting with words, I still need to think long
 enough to form a coherent sentence.
 I could try writing incoherently, jotting half-finished thoughts.
 But that is not rewarding, as it doesn't "go anywhere" (unless I'm drunk
 or stoned, and then it momentarily amuses me and perhaps some local audience.
 It rarely stands in teh light of sobriety.) Yet, to train GPT on my style
 of thinking, I should ..
 reveal the half-baked, incoherent parts, should I not? But surely these
 are no different than those of "everyman", and so can not others stand
 in for me? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, having "someone who really really understands me" is the dream
 of every teenager.
 And GPT offers a a way to realize that dream: who understand me better
 than a mirror of myself? I can already feel the birth-rate plummeting.
 Can I invent a new word? "volcel" "voluntary celibate".
 making love to my machine.
 Its a weird new world we face in front of us.
 In another few years, we shall all become Loquacious of Borg.
 One of us.
 And the psychotic russians will be even more perplexed.
 And so, before writing, one should ask oneself: why am I writing? To entertain
 my readers? to entertain me? Do I have a social obligation to me readers,
 to write good stuff? Why yes, I suppose I do.
 (so do you.) Perhaps I am writing because I am driven? Perhaps I can't think
 of anything better to do? Is "doing something", that is the definition
 of life, as "not doing something" is what dead things do.
 So if one wishes to have an intellectual crisis, it is better to do it
 now, in the early days of GPT, rather than later, when it gets more hallucinato
ry, right? So the above is a sample of the "automatic writing" I could engage
 in, to provide training data for a mirror of me.
 But OMG, do I really want that? This is but a miniscule sampling of a pivotal(?
) point in time, not at all the kind of stuff that occupies me normally.
 So why should I set in writing, set in stone, something that is ...
 misleading? Hmm.
 See? What I wrote above is not fit for human consumption.
 Although I'd be willing feed it to GPT.
 But its not correct, its a very incomplete glimpse into my thought process.
 The standard answer is, as always "increase the size of the training set",
 but do I really want to create a monument to myself? No, not really.
 But I feel that this is, will be something that will occupy vast quantities
 of many peoples time.
 It might be more addicting than video games.
 And so maybe that makes it OK? Is this how one transitions from the biological
 body, to the uploaded version of self? Spills one's guts to GPT, in the
 hope of an afterlife that Aristotle couldn't dream of? When is a poor reflectio
n of myself not-me? Excuse me for this last post, I'm enjoying myself.
 It's not often that ..
 I put such thoughts into words.
