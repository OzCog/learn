Diary and Other Texts
=====================

A diary of research results, plus an assortment of other theoretical and
experimental texts can be found here.

* [***Grammar Induction***](agi-2022/grammar-induction.pdf) --
  AGI 2022 theoretical paper on how to induce grammatical structure
  from unstructured sensory data. (10 pages.)
  [Matching slides for talk](agi-2022-talk/topology-grammar.pdf).
  [Transcript](agi-2022-talk/notes.md).
  This repeats much of the talk given at INLP-2021,
  [***Explainable Patterns***](recognizing-patterns.pdf)
  which was very thinly attended.

* [***Grammar Experiments***](inlp-2022/grammar-experiments.pdf) --
  INLP-2022 report on experimental results from above research program.
  (10 pages.)
  [Matching slides](inlp-2022-talk/experimental-results.pdf),
  [Transcript](inlp-2022-talk/notes.md).

* [***Neural-Net vs. Symbolic Machine Learning***](skippy.pdf) --
  (2018) An attempt to build a bridge between these two styles of
  machine learning. The ideas in this paper are foundational for
  the work being performed in this git repo. (75 pages.)

* [***Stitching***](stitching.pdf) --
  (2018) An explanation of how word-vectors can be "stitched together"
  in a non-linear fashion, so as to extract grammatical (syntactic)
  as well as semantic content in the vectors. Describes one stage
  of the processing pipline implemented in this git repo.

* [***Connector Set Distributions***](connector-sets-revised.pdf) --
  (2017) Report of experimental results, characterizing the
  statistical properties and distribution of disjunts
  ("jigsaw pieces") and their connectors, extracted from
  text corpora of varying sizes. (55 pages.)

* [***Messaging***](messaging.pdf) --
  (2021) A loose jumble of ideas connecting communications, grammar,
  and the statistical mechanics of Link Grammar. Attempts to write
  down a partition function. (9 pages.)

* [***Reading List***](Reading-List.md) --
  A bibliography of notable papers that provide background and
  inspiration for the research being done here.

* [***Entropy***](entropy.pdf) -- Collection of basic definitions and
  notation used elsewhere in these texts. (10 pages.)
